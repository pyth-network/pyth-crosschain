//! This module implements P2P connections for the PythNet service.
//!
//! Originally this code contained a full implementation of a libp2p node, but due to the fact that
//! QUIC+TLS is not yet supported by the Rust ecosystem, we had to resort to replacing this with a
//! small library implemented in Go that connects to the Wormhole network.
//!
//! This works and allows us to keep the program structure the same as if we could do it natively
//! in Rust but it should absolutely be removed once QUIC+TLS is supported in Rust. The change to
//! the program structure should be minimal, and users of the service won't need to change any of
//! their infrastructure.
