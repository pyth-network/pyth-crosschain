# EasyLend Protocol

EasyLend is a simplified lending protocol that uses Express Relay for avoiding value leakage on liquidations.
It uses Pyth price feeds to calculate the asset values and the liquidation thresholds.

This project illustrates how to use the Express Relay SDK for contract integration and publishing opportunities.
