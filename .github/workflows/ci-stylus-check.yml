name: stylus-check
# This workflow runs whenever a PR is opened or updated, or a commit is pushed
# to main. It runs several checks:
# - fmt: checks that the code is formatted according to `rustfmt`.
# - clippy: checks that the code does not contain any `clippy` warnings.
# - doc: checks that the code can be documented without errors.
# - hack: check combinations of feature flags.
# - typos: checks for typos across the repo.

# This configuration allows maintainers of this repo to create a branch and
# pull request based on the new branch. Restricting the push trigger to the
# main branch ensures that the PR only gets built once.
