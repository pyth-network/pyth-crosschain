## Pyth Lazer EVM Contract and SDK

This package is built using [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/).

`PythLazer` is an EVM on-chain contract that keeps track of trusted signers of Pyth Lazer payloads. It allows consumers to easily check validity of Pyth Lazer signatures while enabling key rotation.

`PythLazerReceiver` contains utilities required to validate and parse Pyth Lazer payloads. Contracts should use `PythLazerReceiver` as the base contract (or one of the base contracts) of their contracts to gain access to the provided functions.
