// This script deploys the PythLazer proxy and implementation contract using
// CreateX's contract factory to a deterministic address. Having deterministic
// addresses make it easier for users to access our contracts and also helps in
// making this deployment script idempotent without maintaining any state.
//
// CreateX enables us to deploy the contract deterministically to the same
// address on any EVM chain using various methods. We use the deployer address
// in salt to protect the deployment addresses from being redeployed by other
// wallets so the addresses we use be fully deterministic. We use `create2` to
// deploy the implementation contracts (to have a single address per
// implementation) and `create3` to deploy the proxies (to avoid changing
// addresses if our proxy contract changes, which might sound impossible, but
// can easily happen when you change the optimisation or the solc version!).
// Below you will find more explanation on what these methods.
//
// a `create` opcode (which typical deployment uses) on the EVM would deploy a
// contract to an address that is a hash of the caller address, and the tx
// nonce. Nonce is the tx number and can't be set and therefore it's not easily
// possible to achieve deterministic deployments (unless we somehow make sure
// the deployer never sends transactions prior deployment). That's why there is
// a `create2` opcode that allows us to deploy contracts to an address that is
// a hash of the caller address, a salt, and the contract bytecode. The salt is
// a random number that we can control and therefore we can deploy contracts
// deterministically. The problem with `create2` is that it is the bytecode
// affects the address and therefore we can't deploy different contracts to the
// same address. That's where the idea of `create3` comes in. `create3` is a
// wrapper around create2 and create that achieves it. It deploys a minimal
// fixed-code proxy first using create2 (which will be in a deterministic
// address) and then we call the proxy using the new contract code. The proxy
// then calls `create` to deploy the new contract and since it's the first
// transaction of the proxy the nonce will be 0 and the address will be
// deterministic.
//
// Maybe you are wondering why factory contracts are needed. We need them to
// call create2 and since the caller address matters we need a factory contract
// at a fixed address and that's what CreateX is for. CreateX has a single
// signed transaction to deploy it in any network (and hopefully the key that
// it uses is destroyed!).
