 * This change:
 * - Makes validTimePeriodSeconds configurable and sets its value.
 *   The value depends on the network latency and block time. So
 *   it is read from the network env file.
 * 
 * During this upgrade two transaction will be sent and in between validTimePeriodSeconds
 * will be zero and `getCurrentPrice` will reject. At the time of doing this migration
 * Pyth is not deployed on mainnet and current hard-coded value is large for some
 * networks and it's better to reject rather than accept a price old in the past.
