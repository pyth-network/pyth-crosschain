name: Check Links
# This workflow checks that all links in the documentation are valid.
# It does this for antora docs(adoc) and markdown files.
# We prefer lycheeverse because it is faster, but doesn't support adoc files yet(https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee/issues/291)
# Because of that, we use linkspector for adoc files and lychee for md files.
