{-
  The main workchain ID in TON. Currently, TON has two blockchains:
  1. Masterchain: Used for system-level operations and consensus.
  2. Basechain/Workchain: The primary chain for user accounts and smart contracts.

  While TON supports up to 2^32 workchains, currently only Workchain 0 is active.
  This constant defines the default workchain for smart contract deployment and interactions.

  Note: Gas costs differ between chains:
  - Basechain: 1 gas = 400 nanotons = 0.0000004 TON
  - Masterchain: 1 gas = 10000 nanotons = 0.00001 TON (25x more expensive)
