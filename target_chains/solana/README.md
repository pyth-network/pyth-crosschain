# Solana program for receiving price VAA from Pythnet

The program under `cli` receives a VAA string from the shell, verifies the VAA with wormhole, posts the VAA on solana and then invokes the receiver program under `programs`.
The receiver program verifies that the VAA comes from wormhole (through the `owner` function in `state.rs`) and deserializes the price information (in `decode_posted_vaa` function of `lib.rs`).

```shell
# Generate the program key
# and use the key to replace the following two places
#     "pyth-solana-receiver" in Anchor.toml
#     "declare_id!()" in programs/pyth-solana-receiver/src/lib.rs
> solana-keygen new -o program_address.json

# Build and deploy the receiver program
 > anchor build -- features devnet # use --features mainnet for mainnet
> anchor run deploy

# Build and test the cli program
> anchor run cli_build_devnet
> anchor run cli_test_devnet
# Example output

## Unit tests

Run `anchor run test` to run the unit tests in the `src/tests/` directory.
**Warning**: do not confuse this command with `anchor test`, which doesn't do anything useful.
