# Pyth Crosschain

This repository acts as a monorepo for the various components that make up
Pyth protocols.

Within this monorepo you will find the following subprojects:

## Target Chains

> [target_chains](./target_chains/)

This directory contains on-chain contracts and SDKs for all of the various
blockchain runtimes that Pyth supports. Each subdirectory corresponds to a
blockchain runtime. Inside each subdirectory, there are subfolders for
contracts and SDKs.

## Hermes

> [hermes](./apps/hermes/)

Hermes is an off-chain service which constantly observes Pythnet and the
Wormhole network watching for price updates emitted from the Pyth contract. It
exposes all observed attestations via a public API over HTTPS/WSS which can be
consumed by client-side applications that wish to use Pyth pricing data.

The [`price_service/client`](./price_service/client/) directory provides an SDK for interacting with Hermes.
However, most users will interact with the price service via a chain-specific SDK

For a guide on utilising this service in your project, see the chain-specific SDK
and [examples](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-examples/tree/main/price_feeds) for your blockchain runtime in the `target_chains` directory.

## Fortuna

> [fortuna](./apps/fortuna/)

Fortuna is an off-chain service which can be used by [Entropy](https://pyth.network/entropy) providers.

## Development

### Pull requests

Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) format for your commit messages and PR titles.
In the PR description, please include a summary of the changes and any relevant context. Also, please make sure
to update the package versions following the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) rules.

### Releases

The repository has a CI workflow that will release javascript packages whose version number has changed.
To perform a release, follow these steps:

1. Update the version number in the `package.json` file for the package(s) you wish to release. Please follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for package versions.
2. Submit a PR with the changes and merge them in to main.
3. Create a new tag `pyth-js-v<number>` and push to github. You can simply increment the version number each time -- it doesn't affect any of the published information.
4. Pushing the tag automatically triggers a CI workflow to publish the updated packages to NPM.

If you have a javascript package that shouldn't be published, simply add `"private": "true"` to the `package.json` file
and it will be excluded from the publishing workflow. If you are creating a new public javascript package, you should add
the following config option to `package.json`:

```
  "publishConfig": {
    "access": "public"
  },
```

### pre-commit hooks

pre-commit is a tool that checks and fixes simple issues (formatting, ...) before each commit. You can install it by following [their website](https://pre-commit.com/). In order to enable checks for this repo run `pre-commit install` from command-line in the root of this repo.

The checks are also performed in the CI to ensure the code follows consistent formatting.

### Tilt CI

Integration tests run in Tilt (via the `tilt ci` command). The Tilt CI workflow requires approval from a member of the Pyth team. If you are a member, click on "Details" next to the "Workflow / ci-pyth-crosschain" check in a pull request, and then on the "Resume" button on the workflow page.

### Typescript Monorepo

All of the typescript / javascript packages in this repository are part of a
[turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs) monorepo.

#### Setting up

If you use nix and direnv, just cd to the project directory and `direnv allow`.

If you use nix but not direnv, just cd to the project directory and enter a nix
development shell with `nix develop`.

If you don't use nix at all, then install the required system packages:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) -- match the version to `.nvmrc`; you can use
  [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage your Node.js version.
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) -- match the version to the version specified in
  `package.json`; you can experiment with
  [corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) to manage your pnpm version
  for you.
- [turbo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/getting-started/installation)

#### Common tasks

The following tasks are the most common ways to interact with the monorepo.
Thanks to [turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs), these tasks will
coordinate building any needed dependencies, and task execution will be cached
and will only re-run as necessary. For any of the following tasks, you can pass
[any valid `turbo run` option](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/reference/run)
after `--`, for instance you could run `pnpm test -- --concurrency 2`.

- `pnpm test`: Run all unit tests, integration tests, linting, and format
  checks, as well as whatever other code checks any packages support.
- `pnpm fix`: Run auto fixes, including reformatting code and auto-fixing lint
  rules where possible.
- `pnpm start:dev`: Start all development servers in parallel.
- `pnpm start:prod`: Run production builds and start production mode servers in
  parallel.

#### Building a new package

New packages should be configured with a few requirements in mind:

1. You need to make sure `package.json` scripts are named such that that
   turborepo will hook into them at the expected times.

   - See [turbo.json](./turbo.json) to see the base configuration and ensure you
     use script names that match the tasks that turborepo is configured to run.
   - You don't need to define scripts for all the tasks that are in the root
     `turbo.json` config, just define the ones that make sense for your project.
   - You shouldn't define scripts for tasks that just trigger other tasks;
     instead configure turborepo dependencies to trigger the tasks. This will
     allow turborepo to cache and parallelize things more effectively.
   - In general, `build`, `fix`, and `test` are the main turborepo task graph
     entry points, and any sub-tasks that apply to your package should be
     configured as dependencies somewhere in the graph rooted at one of those.
   - If you need sub-tasks or a task configuration that only apply to your or a
     small few packages, add a package-scoped `turbo.json`, see [the one in the
     insights app](./apps/insights/turbo.json) as an example.

2. Make sure to configure the tools you need and hook up the relevant checks to
   turborepo via the `test` root task so they run on CI. The most common tools
   (eslint, prettier, jest, and typescript) are trivial to configure correctly
   using shared configs, see the relevant config files [in the insights
   app](./apps/insights) as a starting point.

3. If you are writing a package that will be published:

   - Make sure you are dual-exporting cjs and esm correctly, see [how the lazer
     sdk package builds](./lazer/sdk/js/package.json) (in particular look at the
     `build:cjs` and `build:esm` tasks) for an example for how to do this

   - Ensure you have properly configured [subpath
     exports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#subpath-exports) to reference
     the esm and cjs outputs so that your package can be consumed correctly in
     both environments. Again, see [the lazer sdk](./lazer/sdk/js/package.json)
     as an example for doing this correctly.

   - Ensure you have set a `main` and `types` property on your `package.json`
     pointing to your cjs entrypoint for use in older javascript environments.

   - Ensure you configure the `files` property on your `package.json` to include
     all output files and to exclude source files & tooling configuration. This
     will result in smaller package sizes.
