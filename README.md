# Pyth Crosschain

This repository acts as a monorepo for the various components that make up
Pyth protocols.

Within this monorepo you will find the following subprojects:

## Target Chains

> [target_chains](./target_chains/)

This directory contains on-chain contracts and SDKs for all of the various
blockchain runtimes that Pyth supports. Each subdirectory corresponds to a
blockchain runtime. Inside each subdirectory, there are subfolders for
contracts and SDKs.

## Hermes

> [hermes](./apps/hermes/)

Hermes is an off-chain service which constantly observes Pythnet and the
Wormhole network watching for price updates emitted from the Pyth contract. It
exposes all observed attestations via a public API over HTTPS/WSS which can be
consumed by client-side applications that wish to use Pyth pricing data.

The [`price_service/client`](./price_service/client/) directory provides an SDK for interacting with Hermes.
However, most users will interact with the price service via a chain-specific SDK

For a guide on utilising this service in your project, see the chain-specific SDK
and [examples](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-examples/tree/main/price_feeds) for your blockchain runtime in the `target_chains` directory.

## Fortuna

> [fortuna](./apps/fortuna/)

Fortuna is an off-chain service which can be used by [Entropy](https://pyth.network/entropy) providers.

## Local Development

### Setup

Please install the following tools in order to work in this repository:

- [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating) to manage your node version, then run `nvm use 20` to ensure you are using node version 20.
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) in order to use `forge` for Ethereum contract development
- [Solana CLI](https://solana.com/docs/intro/installation) for working with Solana programs.
  - After installing, please run `solana keygen new` to generate a local private key.
- [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation) for developing Solana programs.
- [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) is used to automatically format and lint the repository.
  - After installing, please run `pre-commit install` in the root of the repo to configure the checks to run on each git commit.
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

### Pull requests

Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) format for your commit messages and PR titles.
In the PR description, please include a summary of the changes and any relevant context. Also, please make sure
to update the package versions following the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) rules.

### Releases

The repository has several CI workflows that automatically release new versions of the various components when a new Github release is published.
Each component's workflow uses a specific tag format including the component name and version number (e.g., Fortuna uses the tag `fortuna-vX.Y.Z`).
The general process for creating a new release is:

1. Update the version number of the component in the repo, e.g., in `package.json` or `Cargo.toml` or wherever. Please follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for package versions.
2. Submit a PR with the changes and merge them in to main.
3. Create a new release on github. Configure the release to create a new tag when published. Set the tag name and version for the component you wish to release -- see the [Releases](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/releases) page to identify the relevant tag.
4. Publish the release. This step will automatically trigger a Github Action to build the package and release it. This step will e.g., publish packages to NPM, or build and push docker images.

Note that all javascript packages are released together using a tag of the form `pyth-js-v<number>`. (The `number` is arbitrary.)
If you have a javascript package that shouldn't be published, simply add `"private": "true"` to the `package.json` file
and it will be excluded from the publishing workflow. If you are creating a new public javascript package, you should add
the following config option to `package.json`:

```
  "publishConfig": {
    "access": "public"
  },
```

### Typescript Monorepo

All of the typescript / javascript packages in this repository are part of a
[turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs) monorepo.

#### Setting up

If you use nix and direnv, just cd to the project directory and `direnv allow`.

If you use nix but not direnv, just cd to the project directory and enter a nix
development shell with `nix develop`.

If you don't use nix at all, then install the required system packages:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) -- match the version to `.nvmrc`; you can use
  [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage your Node.js version.
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) -- match the version to the version specified in
  `package.json`; you can experiment with
  [corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) to manage your pnpm version
  for you.
- [turbo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/getting-started/installation)

#### Common tasks

The following tasks are the most common ways to interact with the monorepo.
Thanks to [turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs), these tasks will
coordinate building any needed dependencies, and task execution will be cached
and will only re-run as necessary. For any of the following tasks, you can pass
[any valid `turbo run` option](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/reference/run)
after `--`, for instance you could run `pnpm test -- --concurrency 2`.

- `pnpm test`: Run all unit tests, integration tests, linting, and format
  checks, as well as whatever other code checks any packages support.
- `pnpm fix`: Run auto fixes, including reformatting code and auto-fixing lint
  rules where possible.
- `pnpm start:dev`: Start all development servers in parallel.
- `pnpm start:prod`: Run production builds and start production mode servers in
  parallel.

#### Building a new package

New packages should be configured with a few requirements in mind:

1. You need to make sure `package.json` scripts are named such that that
   turborepo will hook into them at the expected times.

   - See [turbo.json](./turbo.json) to see the base configuration and ensure you
     use script names that match the tasks that turborepo is configured to run.
   - You don't need to define scripts for all the tasks that are in the root
     `turbo.json` config, just define the ones that make sense for your project.
   - You shouldn't define scripts for tasks that just trigger other tasks;
     instead configure turborepo dependencies to trigger the tasks. This will
     allow turborepo to cache and parallelize things more effectively.
   - In general, `build`, `fix`, and `test` are the main turborepo task graph
     entry points, and any sub-tasks that apply to your package should be
     configured as dependencies somewhere in the graph rooted at one of those.
   - If you need sub-tasks or a task configuration that only apply to your or a
     small few packages, add a package-scoped `turbo.json`, see [the one in the
     insights app](./apps/insights/turbo.json) as an example.

2. Make sure to configure the tools you need and hook up the relevant checks to
   turborepo via the `test` root task so they run on CI. The most common tools
   (eslint, prettier, jest, and typescript) are trivial to configure correctly
   using shared configs, see the relevant config files [in the insights
   app](./apps/insights) as a starting point.

3. If you are writing a package that will be published:

   - Make sure you are dual-exporting cjs and esm correctly, see [how the laser
     sdk package builds](./laser/sdk/js/package.json) (in particular look at the
     `build:cjs` and `build:esm` tasks) for an example for how to do this

   - Ensure you have properly configured [subpath
     exports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#subpath-exports) to reference
     the esm and cjs outputs so that your package can be consumed correctly in
     both environments. Again, see [the laser sdk](./laser/sdk/js/package.json)
     as an example for doing this correctly.

   - Ensure you have set a `main` and `types` property on your `package.json`
     pointing to your cjs entrypoint for use in older javascript environments.

   - Ensure you configure the `files` property on your `package.json` to include
     all output files and to exclude source files & tooling configuration. This
     will result in smaller package sizes.
