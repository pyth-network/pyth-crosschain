# Pyth Crosschain

This repository acts as a monorepo for the various components that make up
Pyth Crosschain.

Within this monorepo you will find the following subprojects:

## Target Chains

> [target_chains](./target_chains/)

This directory contains on-chain contracts and SDKs for all of the various
blockchain runtimes that Pyth supports. Each subdirectory corresponds to a
blockchain runtime. Inside each subdirectory, there are subfolders for
contracts, SDKs, and examples.

## Hermes

> [hermes](./hermes/)

Hermes is an off-chain service which constantly observes Pythnet and the
Wormhole network watching for price updates emitted from the Pyth contract. It
exposes all observed attestations via a public API over HTTPS/WSS which can be
consumed by client-side applications that wish to use Pyth pricing data.

The [`price_service/client`](./price_service/client/) directory provides an SDK for interacting with Hermes.
However, most users will interact with the price service via a chain-specific SDK

For a guide on utilising this service in your project, see the chain-specific SDK
and examples for your blockchain runtime in the `target_chains` directory.

## Development

### Pull requests

Use the following format for naming the pull requests:

[component] PR description

For example:

[hermes] Add storage tests

### Releases

The repository has a CI workflow that will release javascript packages whose version number has changed.
To perform a release, follow these steps:

1. Update the version number in the `package.json` file for the package(s) you wish to release. Please follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for package versions.
2. Submit a PR with the changes and merge them in to main.
3. Create a new tag `pyth-js-v<number>` and push to github. You can simply increment the version number each time -- it doesn't affect any of the published information.
4. Pushing the tag automatically triggers a CI workflow to publish the updated packages to NPM.

If you have a javascript package that shouldn't be published, simply add `"private": "true"` to the `package.json` file
and it will be excluded from the publishing workflow. If you are creating a new public javascript package, you should add
the following config option to `package.json`:

```
  "publishConfig": {
    "access": "public"
  },
```

### pre-commit hooks

pre-commit is a tool that checks and fixes simple issues (formatting, ...) before each commit. You can install it by following [their website](https://pre-commit.com/). In order to enable checks for this repo run `pre-commit install` from command-line in the root of this repo.

The checks are also performed in the CI to ensure the code follows consistent formatting.

### Tilt CI

Integration tests run in Tilt (via the `tilt ci` command). The Tilt CI workflow requires approval from a member of the Pyth team. If you are a member, click on "Details" next to the "Workflow / ci-pyth-crosschain" check in a pull request, and then on the "Resume" button on the workflow page.

### Typescript Monorepo

All of the typescript / javascript packages in this repository are part of a lerna monorepo.
This setup allows each package to reference the current version of the others.
You can install dependencies using `npm ci` from the repository root.
You can build all of the packages using `npx lerna run build` and test with `npx lerna run test`.

Lerna has some common failure modes that you may encounter:

1. `npm ci` fails with a typescript compilation error about a missing package.
   This error likely means that the failing package has a `prepare` entry compiling the typescript in its `package.json`.
   Fix this error by moving that logic to the `prepublishOnly` entry.
1. The software builds locally but fails in CI, or vice-versa.
   This error likely means that some local build caches need to be cleaned.
   The build error may not indicate that this is a caching issue, e.g., it may appear that the packages are being built in the wrong order.
   Delete `node_modules/`, `lib/` and `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` from each package's subdirectory. then try again.
