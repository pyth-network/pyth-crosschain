# Pyth Cross-chain Governance Admin CLI Program

The goal of this CLI is interacting with the Pyth Squads multisig.
It allows to :

- Make proposals :
  - `accept-authority`
  - `upgrade-program`
  - `init-price`
  - `propose-token-transfer`
- Interact with proposals :
  - `approve`
  - `activate`
- Inspect proposals :
  - `parse-transaction`

## Usage

Note:

- When using with Ledger, please enable [blind signing](https://www.ledger.com/academy/enable-blind-signing-why-when-and-how-to-stay-safe) in the Solana app settings. TLDR: When you enable blind signing, you enable your device to approve a smart contract transaction, even though it hasn’t been able to display full contract data to you. In other words, you’re agreeing to trust, instead of verify, the transaction. You still have to manually approve each transactions.
- Information about ledger derivation can be found [here](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live-common/blob/master/docs/derivation.md).

### Example

To activate a transaction:

```
npm install
npx lerna run build --scope "xc_admin_common"
npx ts-node src/index.ts activate -t <TRANSACTION_HASH> -c <CLUSTER: [mainnet|devnet|testnet] -v <VAULT_ADDRESS> -w <WALLET_SECRET_KEY_FILEPATH: [filepath|"ledger"]> -lda <LEDGER_DERIVATION_ACCOUNT> -ldc <LEDGER_DERIVATION_CHANGE>

```
