# Pyth Pro FAQ Weekly Update — State

**Last updated (FAQ content):** 2025-01-30

Update this date at the end of every successful FAQ update so the next run knows when the FAQ was last changed.

<!--
HOW TO USE THIS RULE
--------------------
1. When you have a weekly data dump (new Q&A to add or update in the Pyth Pro FAQ):
   - Paste the dump in your message, or attach the file.
   - Mention this rule so the agent uses it, e.g. "Using the FAQ weekly update rule" or @faq-weekly-update.

2. The agent will:
   - Check when the FAQ was last updated (using the date above).
   - Parse the dump and compare with the current FAQ (new vs. modified vs. duplicate).
   - Show you a list of proposed adds and modifications and ask for your approval.

3. You approve (e.g. "Yes, go ahead" / "Add all" / "Skip the one about X").

4. The agent will then:
   - Update content/docs/price-feeds/pro/faq.mdx with the approved changes.
   - Set "Last updated (FAQ content)" at the top of this file to today's date.
   - Summarize what was added, updated, and skipped.

# Pyth Pro FAQ Weekly Update Workflow

Use this workflow when the user provides a **data dump** (file or pasted content) to update the Pyth Pro FAQ.

## 1. Check Last Updated Date

- Read the **Last updated (FAQ content)** date at the top of this file.
- Compare with the date range or context of the data dump (e.g. “questions from week of …”).
- Use this to reason about what is “new” since the last update and avoid re-processing old content.

## 2. Parse the Data Dump

- Treat the user’s message or attached file as the **data dump**.
- Extract every **question** and its **answer** (and any metadata: category, source, etc. if present).
- Normalize phrasing so you can match against existing FAQ questions (e.g. strip extra punctuation, lowercase for comparison).
- If the dump is messy (logs, mixed formats), identify only the Q&A pairs and ignore the rest.

## 3. Diff Against Current FAQ

- Open **content/docs/price-feeds/pro/faq.mdx** and list all current questions (the `####` headings).
- For each Q&A in the dump:
  - **New:** No matching question in the FAQ → candidate to **add**.
  - **Modified:** Same or very similar question exists but the answer differs or is improved → candidate to **update**.
  - **Duplicate:** Same question and same (or equivalent) answer → **skip**, do not add a duplicate.
- Produce a clear list:
  - **To add:** question + proposed answer + suggested category.
  - **To modify:** existing question + proposed new/merged answer.
  - **Skipped (duplicate):** question (optional one-line reason).

## 4. Verify With the User

- **Before editing the FAQ**, present your findings to the user:
  - How many new, modified, and skipped items.
  - For **add**: list each new question, suggested category, and a short summary of the answer.
  - For **modify**: list each existing question and what you would change (e.g. “Update answer to include X and link to Y”).
- Ask the user to confirm:
  - “Do you want to add all of these?” or “Which of these should I add?”
  - “Do you approve these modifications?” or “Which edits should I apply?”
- Do **not** change **content/docs/price-feeds/pro/faq.mdx** or this rule file until the user explicitly approves (e.g. “Yes, go ahead” / “Apply all” / “Add these and skip those”).

## 5. Update the FAQ (After Approval)

- Edit **content/docs/price-feeds/pro/faq.mdx**:
  - **Add** new Q&As under the correct category. Use the same format as existing items:
    - Category heading: `## Category Name` (only if the category already exists).
    - Question: `#### Question text?` (exact H4 style).
    - Answer: one or more paragraphs below, no extra heading.
  - **Modify** only the approved existing questions: replace or extend the answer; keep the same `####` question text unless the user asked to rephrase.
- Preserve existing structure and order:
  - Categories in order: Connection & Subscription → Data Format & Payloads → Market Hours & Schedules → On-Chain Integration → Historical Data → Access Tokens & Permissions → Troubleshooting → Infrastructure.
  - If a new question clearly belongs to a new topic, suggest a new category to the user before adding it; if they agree, add the category in a sensible place (e.g. before “Additional Resources”).
- Conventions:
  - Use **access token** (not “API key”).
  - Prefer internal doc links where relevant: [Subscribe to Prices](/price-feeds/pro/subscribe-to-prices), [Payload Reference](/price-feeds/pro/payload-reference), [Rate Limits](/price-feeds/pro/rate-limits), [Contract Addresses](/price-feeds/pro/contract-addresses), [Market Hours](/price-feeds/pro/market-hours), [REST API](/price-feeds/pro/api/rest), [History API](/price-feeds/pro/api/history), [Integrate as Consumer](/price-feeds/pro/integrate-as-consumer), [Price Feed IDs](/price-feeds/pro/price-feed-ids), [Error Codes](/price-feeds/pro/error-codes).
  - Keep tone concise, technical, second person (“you”).
  - Add links to Pyth Pro Playground or other official URLs when they help (e.g. for “how do I try this?”).

## 6. Update the Last Updated Date in This File

- After all approved changes are written to **content/docs/price-feeds/pro/faq.mdx**, update this rule file:
  - Set **Last updated (FAQ content):** to **today’s date** in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- This ensures the next weekly run knows when the FAQ was last updated.

## 7. Confirm to the User

- Summarize what was done: “Added N questions, updated M, skipped L duplicates.”
- Optionally list the new/updated questions.
- Remind them where the FAQ lives: **content/docs/price-feeds/pro/faq.mdx** and that the “Last updated” date in this rule file was set to today.
