# How to Use Real-Time Data in EVM Contracts

This guide explains how to use real-time Pyth data in EVM contracts. For an interactive playground to explore the methods supported by the Pyth contract, see the [EVM API reference](../api-reference/evm/).

## Install Pyth SDK

Pyth provides a [Solidity SDK](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/ethereum/sdk/solidity) to fetch prices from Pyth contracts.
The SDK exposes `IPyth` interface to interact with Pyth price feeds.

**Truffle/Hardhat**

If you are using Truffle or Hardhat, simply install the NPM package:

```bash copy
npm install @pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity
```

**Foundry**

If you are using Foundry, you will need to create an NPM project if you don't already have one.
From the root directory of your project, run:

```bash copy
npm init -y
npm install @pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity
```

Then add the following line to your `remappings.txt` file:

```text copy
@pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity/=node_modules/@pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity
```

## Write Contract Code

The code snippet below provides a general template for what your contract code should look like:

```solidity {30-31} copy
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity/IPyth.sol";
import "@pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity/PythStructs.sol";

contract SomeContract {
  IPyth pyth;

  /**
   * @param pythContract The address of the Pyth contract
   */
  constructor(address pythContract) {
    // The IPyth interface from pyth-sdk-solidity provides the methods to interact with the Pyth contract.
    // Instantiate it with the Pyth contract address from https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/contract-addresses/evm
    pyth = IPyth(pythContract);
  }

  /**
     * This method is an example of how to interact with the Pyth contract.
     * Fetch the priceUpdate from Hermes and pass it to the Pyth contract to update the prices.
     * Add the priceUpdate argument to any method on your contract that needs to read the Pyth price.
     * See https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/fetch-price-updates for more information on how to fetch the priceUpdate.

     * @param priceUpdate The encoded data to update the contract with the latest price
     */
  function exampleMethod(bytes[] calldata priceUpdate) public payable {
    // Submit a priceUpdate to the Pyth contract to update the on-chain price.
    // Updating the price requires paying the fee returned by getUpdateFee.
    // WARNING: These lines are required to ensure the getPriceNoOlderThan call below succeeds. If you remove them, transactions may fail with "0x19abf40e" error.
    uint fee = pyth.getUpdateFee(priceUpdate);
    pyth.updatePriceFeeds{ value: fee }(priceUpdate);

    // Read the current price from a price feed if it is less than 60 seconds old.
    // Each price feed (e.g., ETH/USD) is identified by a price feed ID.
    // The complete list of feed IDs is available at https://pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids
    bytes32 priceFeedId = 0xff61491a931112ddf1bd8147cd1b641375f79f5825126d665480874634fd0ace; // ETH/USD
    PythStructs.Price memory price = pyth.getPriceNoOlderThan(priceFeedId, 60);
  }
}

```

The code snippet above does the following things:

1. Instantiate the `IPyth` interface from the Solidity SDK using the price feeds [contract address](../contract-addresses/evm).
2. Select the [Price Feed IDs](https://pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids) for the assets you want to fetch prices for. Price feeds come in two varieties, Stable and Beta. You should select Stable feed ids
3. Call `IPyth.getUpdateFee` to calculate the fee charged by Pyth to update the price.
4. Call `IPyth.updatePriceFeeds` to update the price, paying the fee calculated in the previous step.
5. Call `IPyth.getPriceNoOlderThan` to read the current price, providing the [price feed ID](https://pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids) that you wish to read and your acceptable staleness threshold for
   the price.

## Additional Resources

You may find these additional resources helpful for developing your EVM application.

### API Reference

The [EVM API reference](../api-reference/evm/) lets you interactively explore the complete API of the Pyth contract.

### Current Fees

The [Current Fees](../current-fees/) page lists the current fees for each network.

### Error Codes

The [EVM error codes](../error-codes/evm/) page lists the error codes that the Pyth contract may return.

### Example Applications

[Oracle Swap](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-examples/tree/main/price_feeds/evm/oracle_swap) is an end-to-end example application that uses Pyth Network price feeds.
This application is an AMM that allows users to swap two assets at the Pyth-provided exchange rate. The example contains both the contract and a frontend to interact with it.
