**NOTE:** When integrating with **Energy Futures Price Feeds**, it is not recommended to rely solely on the first month expiry price feed as there is often lower liquidity towards expiration.
Best practice is to combine, 1-month, 2-month and 3-month feeds or use the weighted average which is represented by spot price(USOILSPOT or UKOILSPOT).
Please refer to the [Best Practices](../best-practices.mdx#pricing-futures-based-assets) page for more information.
