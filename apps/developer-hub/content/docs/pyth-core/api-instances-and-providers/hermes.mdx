# Hermes

Hermes is an open-source service that listens to the Pythnet and the Wormhole Network for Pyth price updates, and
serves them via a convenient web API.

Hermes allows users to easily [fetch price updates](../fetch-price-updates) via a REST API, or subscribe to server-side streaming
updates.

## Public Endpoints

The Pyth Data Association operates a public endpoint for Hermes, which can be used to test integrations with Pyth
Network:

URL: https://hermes.pyth.network

<InfoBox variant="warning">
For developers building on **Aptos testnet**, **Sui testnet** or **Near testnet**, please use the Hermes Beta endpoint:

URL: https://hermes-beta.pyth.network

</InfoBox>

For production deployments, developers integrating with Pyth Network are **strongly encouraged** to use Node Providers
for maximum resilience and decentralization. Moreover, Hermes is designed to be self-hosted, so developers can run their own
instance of Hermes to fetch Pyth price updates. Please note it is not recommended to use the public endpoint for production as it has rate limits.

## Node Providers

The following node providers offer Hermes:

- [Triton](https://triton.one)
- [P2P](https://p2p.org)
- [extrnode](https://extrnode.com/)
- [Liquify](https://www.liquify.io/)

## Self-Hosting

The Pyth Data Association provides a Helm chart for running Hermes in
[charts](https://github.com/pyth-network/charts/tree/main/charts/hermes) repository. Please refer to the chart's readme
for the configuration values.
You will need a Pythnet RPC to run Hermes; see the [guide for accessing a Pythnet RPC](pythnet-rpc).
