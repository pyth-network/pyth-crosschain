# Sponsored Feeds

The Pyth Data Association sponsors price updates for some feeds on some networks.
Sponsored feeds are updated at a specific heartbeat rate or when the price changes by a specific percentage.
Developers don't need to [pull prices](./fetch-price-updates.mdx) for sponsored feeds, unless they required short update intervals.

The sponsored feeds can vary by network. Please see the relevant section below for the network of interest.

- [EVM](sponsored-feeds/evm)
- [Solana](sponsored-feeds/solana)
- [Aptos](sponsored-feeds/aptos)
- [Sui](sponsored-feeds/sui)
- [Movement](sponsored-feeds/movement)

<InfoBox variant="warning">
  DISCLAIMER: While the Pyth Data Association strives to deliver timely updates,
  these sponsored feeds may occasionally experience delays in updates caused by
  chain halts, gas estimations and other issues. Applications are advised to run
  their own scheduler. Find out how you can run your own scheduler
  [here](/price-feeds/schedule-price-updates/using-scheduler).
