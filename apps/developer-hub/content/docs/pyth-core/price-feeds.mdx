# Price Feeds

Pyth Price Feeds provide real-time, first-party, market data for a wide range of assets.

Every price feed has a **unique ID**, representing the specific pair of assets being priced.
These specific pairs are part of an asset class, which is a broader category of assets.

Anyone can fetch available price feeds and their IDs via [Hermes API](https://hermes.pyth.network/docs/#/rest/price_feeds_metadata).

## Asset Classes

Every price feed belongs to an asset class. These asset classes distinguish between different types of assets, such as crypto, US equities, and metals.

Refer to the [Asset Classes](./price-feeds/asset-classes.md) page to learn more about the existing asset classes.

## Price Feed IDs

Price Feed IDs are unique identifiers for each specific pair of assets being priced (e.g. BTC/USD).
Every price update is tagged with the corresponding price feed ID.

Applications need to store the IDs of the feeds they wish to read.
However, the IDs may be represented in different formats (e.g. hex or base58) depending on the blockchain.
Price feeds also have different IDs in the Stable and Beta channels.

Refer to the [Price Feed ID reference catalog](https://www.pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids) to identify a feed's ID in your chosen ecosystem.

### Solana Price Feed Accounts

On Solana, each feed additionally has a collection of **price feed accounts** containing the feed's data.
The addresses of these accounts are programmatically derived from the feed id and a shard id, which is simply a 16-bit number.
See [How to Use Real-Time Data on Solana](./use-real-time-data/solana#price-feed-accounts) for more information on price feed accounts.
