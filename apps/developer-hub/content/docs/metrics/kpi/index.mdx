title: Pyth Network KPI
description: Monthly informative data points on the Pyth network, its growth, and performance metrics.

_The KPI metrics section has been DISCONTINUED, please visit [here](https://kpi.pyth.network/) for the latest KPI dashboard from July 2024 onwards._

Every month, the Pyth contributors collect informative data points on the network, its growth, as well as its performance.

Disclaimer: All figures mentioned are just rough estimations. Due to Pyth's permissionless nature, any apps can use the Pyth price feeds without talking to the Pyth contributors. This will exclude them from the calculations.

- **Data Publishers**

Data is king, and the Pyth network stands committed to onboarding only high-quality data sources and establishing a natural bridge — without intermediaries — between these sources and the end-users.

- **Price Feeds**

On-chain protocols need sustainable price references, which means they need oracle services. The more price feeds are supported, the more an oracle can provide value to protocols.

- **#PoweredByPyth Applications**

The metrics include all known on-chain dApps composing with Pyth; sometimes, a team using Pyth data may not be known. (If this is the case for you, please inform [here](https://yyyf63zqhtu.typeform.com/ContactPyth?typeform-source=pyth.network)).

From an integrations perspective, one segment the crypto community may overlook is off-chain applications needing pricing data in their own environment.

- **Total Value Secured**

One of the most important metrics is the Total Value Secured (TVS) by the Pyth's price feeds. Price feeds are crucial for your operations, whether you are a borrow-lending protocol or a synthetics platform.

- **Total Trading Volume**

Consider the amount of trading volume dependent on Pyth data. Each protocol has its Pyth integration: perpetual contracts using a CLOB or a vAMM use Pyth as their index reference to set the funding rate. Synthetics platforms use Pyth price feeds as the exchange rate basis for swaps in between synthetic assets. Finally, futures or options protocols (specifically DOVs) integrate Pyth feeds for their derivatives settlement.

- **Client Downloads**

Pyth network is open-sourced, and its data is freely queryable.

You can check Pyth's adoption rate by looking at NPM and Rust downloads.

NPM ("Node Package Manager") is the default package manager for JavaScript's runtime Node.js, which is needed whenever you want to integrate Pyth on your website frontend.

A (Rust) crate is a binary or library. The crate root is a source file that the Rust compiler starts from and makes up the root module of your crate. This enables you to call on-chain data and make your protocol works.
