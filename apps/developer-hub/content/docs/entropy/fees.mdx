The Entropy protocol has been designed to charge fees on a per-request basis. The total fee is
the sum of the provider fee, which is determined by the individual provider on a per-blockchain
basis, and the protocol fee, which is subject to Pyth governance decisions also on a per-chain
basis. These are accessible via the smart contract functions.

Providers can withdraw their fees from the contract whenever they want. The allocation of the fees collected by the Entropy protocol
is governed by the collective decisions of its governance body. All fees are denominated in the native token
of the respective blockchain, ensuring a seamless and integrated operation.

Note that protocols integrating with Entropy can pass these fees along to their users. Whenever a user
submits a transaction that requests a random number, the user can directly pay the entropy fees required
with the native blockchain token. There are no fees for revealing the random numbers.

You can check the current fees in the [contract addresses](contract-addresses) page for each blockchain.
