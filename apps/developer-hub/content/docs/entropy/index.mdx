**Pyth Entropy** is an on-chain random number generator (RNG) designed for developers who need fair, unbiased, and cryptographically secure randomness.
Whether you're building a blockchain game, NFT mint, lottery, or simulation, Entropy delivers randomness that is:

- **Trustless & verifiable** - built on [commit-reveal protocol](./entropy/protocol-design).
- **Low-latency** - randomness available within a [few blocks](./entropy/contract-addresses).
- **Easy to integrate** - Permissionless Integration, including [Visual Tx Explorer](https://entropy-explorer.pyth.network/).
- **Cost-efficient** - designed for scalable production use [fees](./entropy/contract-addresses).
- **Native gas fees** - pay with chain native token.

## What's New in Entropy v2

Entropy v2 introduces several improvements and new features to make random number generation more flexible and efficient.
See [What's New in Entropy v2](whats-new-entropyv2) for more details.
(TODO: Add an infographic here)

## Getting Started

Using Pyth Entropy is permissionless and developers can integrate in a few minutes.
Please see [How to Generate Random Numbers Using Pyth Entropy](generate-random-numbers) to start integrating Pyth Entropy into your application.
