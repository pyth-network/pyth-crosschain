# Entropy

Pyth Entropy allows developers to quickly and easily generate secure random numbers on the blockchain.
Entropy's rapid response time allows developers to build applications such as NFT mints and games with responsive UX.
Entropy also provides [strong security guarantees](protocol-design) to ensure that both users and application developers can trust that the results are random.

Pyth Entropy is currently available on several [EVM networks](contract-addresses).
If you would like a deployment on another network, please [ask in Discord](https://discord.gg/invite/PythNetwork).

## Getting Started

Using Pyth Entropy is permissionless and developers can integrate in a few minutes.
Please see [How to Generate Random Numbers Using Pyth Entropy](generate-random-numbers) to start integrating Pyth Entropy into your application.

## Additional Resources

To learn more about how the protocol works, please see [Protocol design](protocol-design).
