# What's New in Entropy v2

Entropy v2 introduces several improvements and new features to make random number generation more flexible and efficient.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Multiple Request Variants

Entropy v2 provides multiple ways to request random numbers:

- **Basic Request**: Simplest implementation with default settings
- **Custom Gas Limit**: Specify gas limits for complex callbacks
- **Custom Provider**: Choose specific entropy providers
- **Full Control**: Specify all parameters (provider, gas limit, user random number)

### 2. Improved Fee Structure

The new version offers more granular fee calculation:

```solidity
// Get fee for default provider and gas limit
uint256 basicFee = entropy.getFeeV2();

// Get fee for custom gas limit
uint256 customGasFee = entropy.getFeeV2(gasLimit);

// Get fee for specific provider and gas limit
uint256 providerFee = entropy.getFeeV2(provider, gasLimit);
```

### 3. Better Error Handling

Enhanced error messages and more specific error codes help developers debug issues more effectively.

### 4. Gas Optimization

Improved contract efficiency reduces overall gas costs for entropy requests.

## Migration Guide

If you're upgrading from Entropy v1 to v2:

1. Update your imports to use `IEntropyV2`
2. Replace `request()` calls with `requestV2()`
3. Update fee calculation to use `getFeeV2()`
4. Test thoroughly with the new interface

## Backward Compatibility

Entropy v2 maintains backward compatibility with v1 for existing applications. However, we recommend migrating to v2 for new applications to take advantage of the improved features.
