# How to Generate Random Numbers

Integrating Pyth Entropy requires calling an onchain function to request a random number from Entropy. The function takes a random number that one can generate offchain and pass it to the Entropy contract which returns a sequence number. Pyth Entropy will then callback your contract with the generated random number once the request is fulfilled.

See [How to Generate Random numbers in EVM dApps](generate-random-numbers/evm) to integrate your application with Pyth Entropy.
