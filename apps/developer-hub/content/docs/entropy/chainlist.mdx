## Mainnets

<Callout type="warning">
  <div>
    The fees for mainnet are dynamically set. Always use the on-chain method
    `entropy.getFeeV2()` to get the current fee.
  </div>
</Callout>

The following tables shows the total fees payable when using the **default provider**.
Note that the fees shown below will vary over time with prevailing gas prices on each chain.

The Entropy contract is deployed on the following mainnet chains:

<EntropyTable isMainnet={true} />

**The default provider for above mainnet chains is `0x52DeaA1c84233F7bb8C8A45baeDE41091c616506`.**

The default provider on mainnet has a reveal delay to avoid changes on the outcome of the Entropy request because of block reorgs.
The reveal delay shows how many blocks should be produced after the block including the request transaction in order to reveal and submit a callback transaction.

The default provider fulfills the request by sending a transaction with a gas limit as mentioned in above table or as set by the user in the request.
Entropy callbacks the consumer as part of this transaction.

## Testnets

<Callout type="info">
  <div>
    The fees for testnets are kept deliberately low and different from the
    mainnet fees.
  </div>
</Callout>

The Entropy contract is deployed on the following testnet chains:

<EntropyTable isMainnet={false} />

**The default provider for above testnet chains is `0x6CC14824Ea2918f5De5C2f75A9Da968ad4BD6344`.**

The default provider on testnet has reveal delays identical to the corresponding mainnet chains to ensure consistent environment.
