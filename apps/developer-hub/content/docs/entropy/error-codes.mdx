# Error Codes

The following table contains the errors used in the Pyth Network's Entropy [EVM contracts](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/blob/d290f4ec47a73636cf77711f5f68c3455bb8a8ca/target_chains/ethereum/contracts/contracts/entropy/Entropy.sol).
This information is derived from [EntropyErrors.sol](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/blob/d290f4ec47a73636cf77711f5f68c3455bb8a8ca/target_chains/ethereum/entropy_sdk/solidity/EntropyErrors.sol)
in the Pyth EntropySDK and can be used to decode error codes programmatically.
