# Example Applications

The [Coin Flip](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-examples/tree/main/entropy/coin_flip) example demonstrates how to build a smart contract that
interacts with Pyth Entropy as well as a typescript client for that application.

## Other Examples

You can find more examples and tutorials in the [Pyth Examples repository](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-examples/tree/main/entropy).
