# How to Integrate Express Relay as a Searcher

Express Relay allows searchers to integrate once and access all existing and future opportunities across integrated DeFi protocols. Searchers **bid** on these opportunities exposed by Express Relay.

Express Relay exposes different endpoints for interaction, which can be used directly via HTTP, WebSocket, or one of the SDKs for convenience.

## What is a Searcher?

Searchers are sophisticated actors who monitor blockchain networks for profitable opportunities such as arbitrage, liquidations, and MEV extraction. With Express Relay, searchers can:

- **Access unified opportunities** across multiple integrated DeFi protocols
- **Compete in fair auctions** for the right to fulfill user transactions
- **Capture value** while providing better execution for users

## Integration Methods

Express Relay provides multiple ways for searchers to integrate:

- **Direct API integration** using HTTP and WebSocket endpoints
- **SDK integration** with [Typescript](https://github.com/pyth-network/per/tree/main/sdk/js) and [Python](https://github.com/pyth-network/per/tree/main/sdk/python) SDKs
- **Real-time subscriptions** for opportunity monitoring

## Integration Process

Searchers can integrate with Express Relay in three key steps:

### Step 1: Subscribe to New Opportunities

Monitor opportunities across integrated DeFi protocols in real-time using Express Relay's WebSocket or HTTP endpoints. Opportunities include:

- **Market orders** from integrated protocols requiring immediate execution
- **Limit orders** on supported order book systems
- **Liquidation opportunities** from lending and borrowing protocols
- **Arbitrage opportunities** across different decentralized exchanges

### Step 2: Construct and Submit Your Bid

Analyze opportunities and construct competitive bids based on:

- **Your execution strategy** and available capital
- **Gas costs** and transaction efficiency considerations
- **Expected profit margins** and risk assessment
- **Competition** from other searchers in the auction

Submit bids to Express Relay's auction system where the highest bidder wins the right to fulfill the opportunity.

### Step 3: Execute Won Opportunities

If your bid wins the auction, execute the opportunity by:

- **Fulfilling the user's transaction** according to the opportunity parameters
- **Capturing the bid amount** as compensation for providing the service
- **Ensuring proper execution** to maintain reputation in the system

## Supported Chains

Searchers can currently integrate with Express Relay on **Solana Virtual Machine (SVM)** chains, with support for additional chains coming soon.
