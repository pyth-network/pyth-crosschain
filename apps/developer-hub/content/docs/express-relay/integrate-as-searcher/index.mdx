## Integration Methods

Express Relay provides multiple ways for searchers to integrate:

- **Direct API integration** using HTTP and WebSocket endpoints
- **SDK integration** with [Typescript](https://github.com/pyth-network/per/tree/main/sdk/js) and [Python](https://github.com/pyth-network/per/tree/main/sdk/python) SDKs
- **Real-time subscriptions** for opportunity monitoring

## Integration Process

Searchers can integrate with Express Relay in three key steps:

### Step 1: Subscribe to New Opportunities

Monitor opportunities across integrated DeFi protocols in real-time using Express Relay's WebSocket or HTTP endpoints. Opportunities include:

- **Market orders** from integrated protocols requiring immediate execution
- **Limit orders** on supported order book systems
- **Liquidation opportunities** from lending and borrowing protocols
- **Arbitrage opportunities** across different decentralized exchanges

### Step 2: Construct and Submit Your Bid

Analyze opportunities and construct competitive bids based on:

- **Your execution strategy** and available capital
- **Gas costs** and transaction efficiency considerations
- **Expected profit margins** and risk assessment
- **Competition** from other searchers in the auction

Submit bids to Express Relay's auction system where the highest bidder wins the right to fulfill the opportunity.

### Step 3: Execute Won Opportunities

If your bid wins the auction, execute the opportunity by:

- **Fulfilling the user's transaction** according to the opportunity parameters
- **Capturing the bid amount** as compensation for providing the service
- **Ensuring proper execution** to maintain reputation in the system
