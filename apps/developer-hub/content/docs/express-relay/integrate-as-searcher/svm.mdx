# SVM Searcher Integration

SVM Express Relay searchers fulfill market order opportunities as well as limit orders on the [Limo](https://solscan.io/account/LiMoM9rMhrdYrfzUCxQppvxCSG1FcrUK9G8uLq4A1GF) program.

## Step 1: Subscribe to New Opportunities

Express Relay provides searchers with [Typescript](https://github.com/pyth-network/per/tree/358eedc1f9072cdfc3418fba309697580f2474f9/sdk/js) and [Python](https://github.com/pyth-network/per/tree/358eedc1f9072cdfc3418fba309697580f2474f9/sdk/python) SDKs to interact with Express Relay. Searchers can also directly fetch available opportunities via HTTP or subscribe to them via WebSocket.

### Typescript SDK

Pyth provides a Typescript SDK, which allows searchers to subscribe to opportunities:

```typescript
import { Client, Opportunity } from "@pythnetwork/express-relay-js";

const handleOpportunity = async (opportunity: Opportunity) => {
  console.log("Received opportunity");
  // Implement your opportunity handler here
};

const client = new Client(
  { baseUrl: "https://per-mainnet.dourolabs.app" },
  undefined, // Default WebSocket options
  handleOpportunity,
);

async function main() {
  await client.subscribeChains(["solana"]);
}

main();
```

### Python SDK

Pyth provides a Python SDK, which allows searchers to subscribe to opportunities:

```python
import asyncio
from express_relay.client import (
    ExpressRelayClient,
)
from express_relay.models import Opportunity

async def opportunity_callback(opportunity: Opportunity):
    print("Received opportunity")
    # Implement your opportunity handler here

client = ExpressRelayClient(
    "https://per-mainnet.dourolabs.app",
    None,
    opportunity_callback,
    None,
)

async def main():
    await client.subscribe_chains(["solana"])
    task = await client.get_ws_loop()
    await task

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### HTTP API

Searchers can request opportunities through an HTTP **GET** call to the [/v1/opportunities](https://per-mainnet.dourolabs.app/docs#tag/opportunity/operation/get_opportunities) endpoint.

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://per-mainnet.dourolabs.app/v1/opportunities?chain_id=solana&mode=live'
```

Opportunities are short-lived and could be executed in a matter of seconds. So, the above endpoint could return an empty response.

### WebSocket API

Searchers can connect to the server via WebSocket to reduce latency and subscribe to various events. The WebSocket endpoint lives at `/v1/ws` (e.g `wss://per-mainnet.dourolabs.app/v1/ws`). Here is a sample JSON payload to subscribe to opportunities:

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "method": "subscribe",
  "params": {
    "chain_ids": ["solana"]
  }
}
```

Consult the [Websocket API reference](../websocket-api-reference) for a complete list of methods and parameters.

The server responds with opportunities in the following format:

```json
{
  "order": "UxMUbQAsjrfQUp5stVwMJ6Mucq7VWTvt4ICe69BJ8lVXqwM+0sysV8OqZTdM0W4p...", // The Limo order to be executed, encoded in base64
  "order_address": "DUcTi3rDyS5QEmZ4BNRBejtArmDCWaPYGfN44vBJXKL5", // Address of the order account
  "program": "limo", // Identifier of the program that the order exists in
  "chain_id": "development-solana",
  "version": "v1" // Opportunity format version
}
```

## Step 2: Construct the Bid

Searchers should construct a bid by evaluating the fetched opportunity.

> **Warning**: Before constructing the bid, make sure your wallet has the required assets to fulfill the limit order and SOL to pay the bid amount.

See the following examples of how to construct a bid object via the SDKs:

### Typescript SDK

Below is an excerpt of example code. See the full example in the [Typescript SDK](https://github.com/pyth-network/per/blob/4be711525948cf24c0ebd4ebab007dc7f51b7069/sdk/js/src/examples/simpleSearcherLimo.ts).

```typescript
import { OpportunitySvm } from "../index";
import { BidSvm } from "../types";

import * as anchor from "@coral-xyz/anchor";
import * as limo from "@kamino-finance/limo-sdk";

/**
 * Generates a bid for a given opportunity.
 * The transaction in this bid transfers assets from the searcher's wallet to fulfill the limit order.
 * @param opportunity The SVM opportunity to bid on.
 * @returns The generated bid object.
 */
async generateBid(opportunity: OpportunitySvm): Promise<BidSvm> {
  const order = opportunity.order;
  const limoClient = new limo.LimoClient(
    this.connectionSvm,
    order.state.globalConfig
  );

  const { bid: bidAmountLamports, transaction } = await this.fulfillLimoOrder(
    limoClient,
    order,
    this.searcherKeypair,
    this.bidAmountLamports
  );

  return {
    amount: bidAmountLamports.toString(),
    transaction: transaction,
    valid_until: this.getValidUntil(),
  };
}
```

### Python SDK

Below is an excerpt of example code. See the full example in the [Python SDK](https://github.com/pyth-network/per/blob/4be711525948cf24c0ebd4ebab007dc7f51b7069/sdk/python/express_relay/examples/simple_searcher_limo.py).

```python
import asyncio
from typing import Dict, Any

from solders.keypair import Keypair  # type: ignore
from solders.transaction import VersionedTransaction  # type: ignore

async def construct_bid(self, opportunity: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Constructs a bid for the given opportunity.
    """
    order = opportunity["order"]
    order_address = opportunity["order_address"]

    # Calculate bid amount and construct fulfillment transaction
    bid_amount, transaction = await self.fulfill_limo_order(
        order, order_address, self.searcher_keypair, self.bid_amount_lamports
    )

    return {
        "amount": str(bid_amount),
        "transaction": transaction,
        "valid_until": self.get_valid_until(),
    }
```

## Step 3: Submit the Bid

After constructing the bid, searchers should submit it to Express Relay to participate in the auction.

### Typescript SDK

```typescript
// Submit the bid to Express Relay
const bidResponse = await client.submitBid(bid);
console.log("Bid submitted:", bidResponse);
```

### Python SDK

```python
# Submit the bid to Express Relay
bid_response = await client.submit_bid(bid)
print(f"Bid submitted: {bid_response}")
```

### HTTP API

Searchers can submit bids through an HTTP **POST** call to the [/v1/bids](https://per-mainnet.dourolabs.app/docs#tag/bid/operation/post_bid) endpoint.

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://per-mainnet.dourolabs.app/v1/bids' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "amount": "1000000",
    "transaction": "...",
    "chain_id": "solana",
    "valid_until": "2024-05-30T13:23:00.000Z"
  }'
```

## Step 4: Monitor Bid Results

After submitting a bid, searchers should monitor whether their bid was accepted and the transaction was successfully executed.

### Winning Bids

If your bid wins the auction, Express Relay will execute your transaction on-chain. You can monitor the transaction status through:

- **Transaction hash** returned in the bid response
- **WebSocket notifications** for bid status updates
- **HTTP polling** of bid status endpoints

### Failed Bids

If your bid is not selected or execution fails, you'll receive appropriate error notifications. Common reasons for bid failure include:

- **Insufficient bid amount** - Another searcher bid higher
- **Transaction execution failure** - Insufficient funds or invalid transaction
- **Timeout** - Bid submitted after opportunity expired

## Error Handling

Implement proper error handling for common scenarios:

### Network Errors

```typescript
try {
  const bidResponse = await client.submitBid(bid);
} catch (error) {
  if (error.code === "NETWORK_ERROR") {
    // Retry submission
    console.log("Network error, retrying...");
  }
}
```

### Invalid Opportunities

```typescript
const handleOpportunity = async (opportunity: Opportunity) => {
  try {
    // Validate opportunity before bidding
    if (!isValidOpportunity(opportunity)) {
      console.log("Invalid opportunity, skipping");
      return;
    }

    const bid = await generateBid(opportunity);
    await client.submitBid(bid);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error processing opportunity:", error);
  }
};
```

## Best Practices

### Performance Optimization

- **Use WebSocket connections** for real-time opportunity updates
- **Implement efficient bid calculation** to minimize latency
- **Cache frequently used data** like token prices and account information

### Risk Management

- **Set maximum bid amounts** to control potential losses
- **Implement position limits** to manage overall exposure
- **Monitor profitability** and adjust strategies accordingly

### Monitoring and Logging

- **Log all opportunities** received for analysis
- **Track bid success rates** and profitability metrics
- **Monitor system health** and performance indicators
