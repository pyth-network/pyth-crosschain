## Publisher Rewards

22% — 2,200,000,000 PYTH

This allocation is reserved for the Pyth Network data providers, or "publishers".

The publishers are responsible for publishing price data to the Pyth Network. The "Publisher Rewards" allocation consists of reserved tokens for various reward mechanisms and grant programs to encourage publishers to publish accurate and timely price data.

This is designed to encourage more publishers to support new symbols which may lack the initial popularity or liquidity for the network to launch immediately.

~2% (50M) of the 2.2B PYTH Tokens are unlocked. The remaining PYTH Tokens (2.15B) are subject to the lockup schedule described above. Note that these rewards can only be distributed to publishers once they are unlocked.

52% — 5,200,000,000 PYTH

The "Ecosystem Growth" allocation is a strategic portion of tokens set aside for contributors to the Pyth Network, including developers, educators, researchers, strategic contributors, early publishers, and more.

This allocation aims to facilitate practical initiatives including funding research projects aimed at advancing the Pyth Network, incentivizing developers to build complementary tooling and resources, and supporting public education programs to increase awareness. This allocation aims to recognize and reward individuals and organizations that go beyond the contributors in fostering the expansion and vitality of the Pyth Network.

13% (700M) of the 5.2B PYTH Tokens are unlocked. The remaining tokens (4.5B) are subject to the unlock schedule described above.
