## Publisher Rewards

22% — 2,200,000,000 PYTH

This allocation is reserved for the Pyth Network data providers, or "publishers".

The publishers are responsible for publishing price data to the Pyth Network. The "Publisher Rewards" allocation consists of reserved tokens for various reward mechanisms and grant programs to encourage publishers to publish accurate and timely price data.

This is designed to encourage more publishers to support new symbols which may lack the initial popularity or liquidity for the network to launch immediately.

~2% (50M) of the 2.2B PYTH Tokens are unlocked. The remaining PYTH Tokens (2.15B) are subject to the lockup schedule described above. Note that these rewards can only be distributed to publishers once they are unlocked.
