---

In order to maximize the reliability of the Pyth Hermes and Benchmarks APIs, a request rate limit is enforced. All endpoints limits are set at **30 requests every 10 seconds per IP address**.

**One exception**: the TradingView endpoint will allow 90 requests every 10 seconds. Clients issuing request above the limit will receive a 429 (Too Many Requests) response for the subsequent 60-second period.
