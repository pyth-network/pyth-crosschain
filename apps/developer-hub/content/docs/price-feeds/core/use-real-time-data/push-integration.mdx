This guide explains how to read real-time Pyth prices using push integration across supported ecosystems.

<Callout type="info" title="Check Feed Availability">
  Ensure the feeds your application needs are already updated on-chain. Review
  the [push feeds list](/price-feeds/core/push-feeds), request coverage through
  the [update request form](https://tally.so/r/nGz2jj), or operate a [Price
  Pusher](/price-feeds/core/schedule-price-updates/using-price-pusher) to
  publish updates yourself.
</Callout>

## EVM

Developers on EVM chains can read prices directly from the Pyth oracle contract using push feeds.

```solidity copy
PythStructs.Price memory price = pyth.getPriceNoOlderThan(priceFeedId, 60);
```

Provide the price feed ID from the [push feeds list](/price-feeds/core/push-feeds).

### Sample contract

```solidity {30-31} copy
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity/IPyth.sol";
import "@pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity/PythStructs.sol";

contract SomeContract {
  IPyth pyth;

  /**
   * @param pythContract The address of the Pyth contract
   */
  constructor(address pythContract) {
    // The IPyth interface from pyth-sdk-solidity provides the methods to interact with the Pyth contract.
    // Instantiate it with the Pyth contract address from https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/core/contract-addresses/evm
    pyth = IPyth(pythContract);
  }

  /**
   * This method is an example of how to interact with the Pyth contract using Push Integration.
   */
  function exampleMethod() public {
    // Read the current price from a price feed if it is less than 60 seconds old.
    // Each price feed (e.g., ETH/USD) is identified by a price feed ID.
    // The complete list of feed IDs is available at https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/core/price-feeds
    bytes32 priceFeedId = 0xff61491a931112ddf1bd8147cd1b641375f79f5825126d665480874634fd0ace; // ETH/USD
    PythStructs.Price memory price = pyth.getPriceNoOlderThan(priceFeedId, 60);
  }
}

```

## SVM

Developers on Solana and related ecosystems can use price feed accounts to consume push feeds. See the
[Solana integration guide](/price-feeds/core/use-real-time-data/pull-integration/solana#price-feed-accounts) for implementation details.

## Aptos

Developers on Aptos can read push feeds from the Pyth oracle contract:

```rust copy
let btc_price_identifier = x"e62df6c8b4a85fe1a67db44dc12de5db330f7ac66b72dc658afedf0f4a415b43";
let btc_usd_price_id = price_identifier::from_byte_vec(btc_price_identifier);
pyth::get_price(btc_usd_price_id)
```
