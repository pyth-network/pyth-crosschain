The following tables contain the errors used in the Pyth Network's [SVM contracts](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/solana).
This information is derived from the [pyth-solana-receiver error.rs](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/blob/main/target_chains/solana/programs/pyth-solana-receiver/src/error.rs)
and [pyth_solana_receiver_sdk error.rs](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/blob/main/target_chains/solana/pyth_solana_receiver_sdk/src/error.rs)
files and can be used to decode error codes programmatically.
