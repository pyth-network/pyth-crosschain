title: Why Update Prices
description: Understand why Pyth pull-oracle integrations must refresh on-chain prices

Pyth uses a pull oracle model. Unlike traditional push oracles that automatically update prices on-chain at regular intervals, Pyth requires users to explicitly update the on-chain price before reading it.

This design offers several advantages:

- **Lower costs**: You only pay for price updates when you need them
- **Lower latency**: You can fetch the latest price update directly from Pyth's low-latency oracle network and submit it on-chain immediately
- **Flexibility**: Different applications can update prices at different frequencies based on their needs

In the pull integration pattern, your contract must:

1. Accept `priceUpdate` data from the caller (fetched from [Hermes](./how-pyth-works/hermes))
2. Call `updatePriceFeeds()` to submit this data on-chain before reading prices
3. Pay a small fee for each update (calculated via `getUpdateFee()`)

If you don't update the price or if the on-chain price becomes too stale, calls to `getPriceNoOlderThan()` will revert with a `StalePrice` error. See [how to fetch price updates](./fetch-price-updates) for more details on obtaining price updates.
