Hermes is an open-source service that listens to the Pythnet and the Wormhole Network for Pyth price updates, and
serves them via a convenient web API.

Hermes allows users to easily [fetch price updates](../fetch-price-updates) via a REST API, or subscribe to server-side streaming
updates.

## Public Endpoints

The Pyth Data Association operates a public endpoint for Hermes, which can be used to test integrations with Pyth
Network:

URL: https://hermes.pyth.network

<Callout type="warning" title="Hermes Beta">
For developers building on **Aptos testnet**, **Sui testnet** or **Near testnet**, please use the Hermes Beta endpoint:
URL: https://hermes-beta.pyth.network

</Callout>

### Rate limits

In order to maximize the reliability of the Public Hermes API, a request rate limit is enforced.
All endpoints limits are set at 30 requests every 10 seconds per IP address.
Clients issuing request above the limit will receive a 429 (Too Many Requests) response for the subsequent 60-second period.

For production deployments, developers integrating with Pyth Network are **strongly encouraged** to use Node Providers
for maximum resilience and decentralization.

## Node Providers

The following node providers offer Hermes:

- [Triton](https://triton.one)
- [P2P](https://p2p.org)
- [extrnode](https://extrnode.com/)
- [Liquify](https://www.liquify.io/)
