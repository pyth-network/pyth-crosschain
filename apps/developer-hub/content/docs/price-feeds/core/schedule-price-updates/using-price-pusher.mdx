The [Price Pusher](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/apps/price_pusher)
is an off-chain service that continuously pulls price updates onto a blockchain.
Anyone can operate this service to keep on-chain Pyth prices current based on configurable criteria such as minimum update intervals or price change thresholds.

Running the Price Pusher is a straightforward way to migrate from a push oracle: protocols that depend on regular updates can achieve the same behavior by operating this service. Refer to the project README for setup instructions and configuration details.
