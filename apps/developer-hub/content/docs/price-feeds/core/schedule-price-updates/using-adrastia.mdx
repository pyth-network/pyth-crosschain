[Adrastia](https://adrastia.io) is an automation platform founded by TRILEZ SOFTWARE INC. leveraging more than a decade of operational experience with AI agents to deliver reliable automated systems. The team emphasizes reliability, transparency, and prudence while helping DeFi projects enhance data freshness and resilience.

## Pyth Price Feed Updater

Adrastia’s Pyth Price Feed Updater is a managed, white-glove service that pushes price updates as soon as configured trigger conditions are met. Integration is intentionally lightweight—Adrastia operates the infrastructure so teams can keep their focus on product development.

## Engagement Process

Adrastia is building a decentralized, permissionless experience for managing automation workloads. Until that interface ships, onboarding follows a simple off-chain workflow:

1. Contact Adrastia via [support@adrastia.io](mailto:support@adrastia.io) or [Discord](https://discord.adrastia.io/).
2. Share the price feed IDs you want to keep updated on-chain.
3. Review the configuration (public or private) they prepare in GitHub and propose adjustments if needed.
4. Sign the service agreement authorizing Adrastia to run automation on your behalf.
5. Fund the Automatos worker addresses they provide with the gas required for updates.
6. Receive access to the analytics dashboard once the service is live.
7. Request a dedicated status page to monitor execution (optional).
8. Settle the monthly invoice for the service.

## Configuration Model

Each price feed can trigger updates when:

- The price changes by at least a specified threshold, or
- The heartbeat interval elapses, ensuring at least one update within the chosen period

Feeds can also define **early update** rules. When one feed meets its primary condition, Adrastia can preemptively update related feeds to save gas by batching proofs and transactions.
