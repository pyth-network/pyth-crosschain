The API reference is a comprehensive guide to the various APIs -- both on- and off-chain -- that developers can use in their applications.
Developers can consult this reference to better understand what methods exist and what they do.
The API reference is interactive, so developers can try out the APIs from the website to better understand their behavior.

The following on-chain contracts are documented in the API reference:

- [EVM](https://api-reference.pyth.network/price-feeds/evm/getPriceNoOlderThan)

Hermes also has interactive API documentation hosted by the service itself:

- [Hermes](https://hermes.pyth.network/docs/)
- [Benchmarks / Historical Prices](https://benchmarks.pyth.network/docs)
