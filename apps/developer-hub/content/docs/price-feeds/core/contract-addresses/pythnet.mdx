<Callout type="warning" title="Use These Addresses for Pythnet Only">
  **Important:** The addresses on this page are for the Pythnet network itself,
  which is used to construct and deliver Pyth prices to other blockchains. If
  you are building an application on EVM, Solana, SVM, or another chain, you
  should use the Pyth program deployed on your target chain instead. Please
  refer to the [Contract Addresses](/price-feeds/core/contract-addresses) page
  and select your specific blockchain environment.
</Callout>

The following tables contain the addresses of the programs deployed on Pythnet environments that operate together to construct Pyth prices and deliver them to other blockchains:

Note: Pythnet is the mainnet network for Pyth, and Pythtest is a testnet for development purposes.
