Reference for Pyth Pro payload structure, field specifications, and binary formats. For implementation details, see our [integration guides](/price-feeds/pro/integrate-as-consumer).

| [`publisherCount`](#publishercount) | `u16` | All | Number of contributing publishers |
| [`marketSession`](#marketsession) | `string` | All | Trading session status |
| [`bestBidPrice`](#bestbidprice) | `i64?` | Spot | Highest bid across publishers |

## Working with Prices

<Callout type="warning">
All price values use **mantissa representation**:

```
actual_price = mantissa × 10^exponent
```

**Example**: `1006900000000 × 10^(-8) = $10,069.00`

### Core Price Properties

<Accordions type="multiple" defaultValue={["price"]}>
<Accordion id="price" title="price">

Aggregate market price calculated from all contributing publishers.

| Availability | Only if requested in subscription |
| Algorithm | See [price aggregation](/price-feeds/core/how-pyth-works/price-aggregation) |

<Callout type="warning">
The `price` field may be absent if the price couldn't be computed. Use the last valid price or wait for a fresh update.
</Callout>

</Accordion>

| Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Type | `i64` (optional) |
| Availability | Only if requested in subscription |

<Callout type="info">
**How to Choose**: Format names are historical — choose based on which signing algorithm is most efficient for your target chain, not the chain name. The `solana` format (Ed25519) has been used on non-SVM chains when it was the most efficient algorithm.
