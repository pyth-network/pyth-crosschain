This page provides a comprehensive reference for understanding Pyth Pro payload structure, field specifications, and available data formats. This information is essential for integrating with Pyth Pro as a consumer and understanding the data you receive.

<Callout type="info">
  This reference is designed for both technical and non-technical stakeholders
  to understand Pyth Pro's data offering. For implementation details, see our
  [integration guides](/price-feeds/pro/integrate-as-consumer).

## What is a Pyth Pro Payload?

A Pyth Pro payload is a real-time data update containing financial market information with cryptographic signatures for verification on blockchain. When you subscribe to Pyth Pro price feeds, you receive `StreamUpdated` messages containing this structured data.

## Available Properties

When subscribing to Pyth Pro, specify which properties you want to receive. Select the tab below to view properties by feed type:

<Tabs items={["Spot Trading", "Derivatives", "Common (All Feeds)"]}>
  <Tab value="Spot Trading">
    Properties for spot price feeds (e.g., BTC/USD, ETH/USD):

    | Property | Type | Description |
    | -------- | ---- | ----------- |
    | `price` | `i64` | Aggregate market price from all publishers. Represented as mantissa; multiply by `10^exponent` for actual price. |
    | `confidence` | `i64` | Price uncertainty interval representing publisher disagreement. Higher values = more uncertainty. Used for risk assessment. |
    | `bestBidPrice` | `i64` | Highest bid price across all publishers. The best price at which you could sell. |
    | `bestAskPrice` | `i64` | Lowest ask price across all publishers. The best price at which you could buy. |

    **Example subscription:**
    ```js
    properties: ["price", "confidence", "bestBidPrice", "bestAskPrice"]
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Derivatives">
    Properties for perpetual futures funding rate feeds:

    | Property | Type | Description |
    | -------- | ---- | ----------- |
    | `fundingRate` | `i64` | Current funding rate for perpetual futures. Positive = longs pay shorts; negative = shorts pay longs. |
    | `fundingTimestamp` | `u64` | Unix timestamp in microseconds when funding rate was last calculated by the exchange. |
    | `fundingRateInterval` | `u64` | Duration in microseconds between funding rate updates. Typically 8 hours (28,800,000,000 μs) for major exchanges. |

    **Example subscription:**
    ```js
    properties: ["fundingRate", "fundingTimestamp", "fundingRateInterval"]
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Common (All Feeds)">
    Properties available for all feed types:

    | Property | Type | Description |
    | -------- | ---- | ----------- |
    | `publisherCount` | `u16` | Number of data publishers currently contributing to this feed. More publishers = higher reliability. |
    | `exponent` | `i16` | Decimal exponent for price conversion. Use formula: `actual_price = mantissa × 10^exponent`. Typically `-8` for USD prices. |
    | `marketSession` | `string` | Current trading session status: `regular` (normal hours), `preMarket`, `postMarket`, `overNight`, or `closed`. |

    **Example subscription:**
    ```js
    properties: ["price", "exponent", "publisherCount", "marketSession"]
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info">
  **Customizable Payload**: The payload structure is customizable based on the
  properties you request in your subscription. Only the fields you specify will
  be included in the response. See [Property
  Specifications](#property-specifications) for detailed information on each
  field.
</Callout>

## What does a price feed update look like?

Each price feed in the priceFeeds array represents real-time market data for a specific trading pair (e.g., BTC/USD, ETH/USD).

<Callout type="warning">
  **Important**: The price is stored in two parts: an integer mantissa value
  (the `price` field) and a power-of-ten `exponent`.
  <br /> The actual decimal representation of the price is given by:
  `decimal_price = price × 10^exponent`.
  <br /> For example: `1006900000000 × 10^(-8) = $10,069.00`

## Binary Formats & Signature Schemes

Pyth Pro provides multiple cryptographic formats to support different blockchain ecosystems. When you subscribe, you can request specific binary formats using the `formats` parameter.

<BinaryFormatCards />

<Callout type="info">
  **How to Choose**: Select the format based on your target blockchain's native
  cryptographic primitives. The `evm` format works for all EVM chains, `solana`
  for Ed25519-native chains, and `leUnsigned` for offchain applications that
  don't need signature verification.
