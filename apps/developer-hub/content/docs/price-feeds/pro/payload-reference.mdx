This page provides a comprehensive reference for understanding Pyth Pro payload structure, field specifications, and available data formats.

<Callout type="info">
  This reference is designed for both technical and non-technical stakeholders
  to understand Pyth Pro's data offering. For implementation details, see our

## What is a Pyth Pro Payload?

A Pyth Pro payload is a real-time data update containing financial market information with cryptographic signatures for verification on blockchain. When you subscribe to Pyth Pro price feeds, you receive `StreamUpdated` messages containing this structured data.

/>

<Callout type="info">
  **Price Availability Semantics**: In rare cases, the `price` field may be
  absent from the response. This can only happen when a feed has been recently
  activated and no price has ever been produced yet. Once a feed produces its
  first valid price, a price will always be provided for that feed going
  forward.

To determine when the price was generated, consumers must check
`feedUpdateTimestamp`:

- If `feedUpdateTimestamp` is equal to the update's `timestampUs`, the price
  was generated as part of this update.
- If `feedUpdateTimestamp` is earlier than `timestampUs`, the price is the
  most recent available price, carried forward from the time indicated by
  `feedUpdateTimestamp`, not generated at the current update time.

Consumers should always rely on `feedUpdateTimestamp` to understand the
freshness and origin of the price.

## Binary Formats & Signature Schemes

Pyth Pro provides multiple cryptographic formats to support different blockchain ecosystems. When you subscribe, you can request specific binary formats using the `formats` parameter.

<BinaryFormatCards />

<Callout type="info">
  **How to Choose**: Select the format based on your target blockchain's native
  cryptographic primitives. The `evm` format works for all EVM chains, `solana`
  for Ed25519-native chains, and `leUnsigned` for offchain applications that
  don't need signature verification.
