Pyth Pro does not impose hard technical rate limits on API requests. Instead, subscription parameters — such as the number of WebSocket connections, price feeds, and update channels — are defined by your service agreement.

## What Is Governed by Your Agreement

- Number of concurrent WebSocket connections.
- Price feeds available for subscription.
- Update channels and frequencies.

## Questions

If you have questions about your subscription parameters or need to adjust your limits, contact the Pyth team through the channels provided in your service agreement.
