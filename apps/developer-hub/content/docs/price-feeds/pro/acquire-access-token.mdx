This guide explains how to acquire an access token for Pyth Pro, which is required to authenticate websocket connections and subscribe to price updates.

## Request Access Token

Please fill out [this form](https://2fga8d.share-eu1.hsforms.com/2ftdPrASCTLCxtP5YMzAq_Q) to get in touch with our authorized distribution partners (Pyth Data Distributors) and obtain an access token.

<Callout type="info">
  Access tokens are required for all Pyth Pro websocket connections. Make sure
  to keep your token secure and do not share it publicly.
</Callout>

## Using the Access Token

Once you receive your access token, use it to authenticate the websocket connection by passing it as an `Authorization` header with the value `Bearer {token}`.

### Example Usage

```js copy
import { PythLazerClient } from "@pythnetwork/pyth-lazer-sdk";

const client = await PythLazerClient.create(
  [
    "wss://pyth-lazer-0.dourolabs.app/v1/stream",
    "wss://pyth-lazer-1.dourolabs.app/v1/stream",
  ],
  "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",
);
```

## Next Steps

After acquiring your access token, you can proceed to [subscribe to price feeds](./subscribe-to-prices) using the Pyth Pro websocket API.
