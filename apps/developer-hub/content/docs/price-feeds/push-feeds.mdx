# Push Feeds

The Pyth Data Association **pushes** price updates for various feeds on some networks.
These feeds are updated at a specific heartbeat rate or when the price changes by a specific percentage.
Applications can depend on receiving updates for these feeds, without having to pull them explicitly.

The feeds can vary by network. Please see the relevant section below for the network of interest.

- [EVM](push-feeds/evm)
- [Solana](push-feeds/solana)
- [Fogo](push-feeds/fogo)
- [Aptos](push-feeds/aptos)
- [Movement](push-feeds/movement)
- [Sui](push-feeds/sui)

  DISCLAIMER: While the Pyth Data Association strives to deliver timely updates,
  these push feeds may occasionally experience delays in updates caused by chain
  halts, gas estimations and other issues. Applications are advised to run their
  own price-pusher. Find out how you can run your own price-pusher
  [here](/price-feeds/schedule-price-updates/using-price-pusher).
