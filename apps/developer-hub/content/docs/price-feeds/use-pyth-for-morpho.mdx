# How to use Pyth for Morpho Markets

This guide will show how you can leverage Pyth real-time price data to power Morpho markets.

Pyth provides a wrapper which implements Morpho's `IOracle` interface called [`pyth-morpho-wrapper`](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-morpho-wrapper).

There are two steps to use Pyth price feeds for Morpho markets:

1. Schedule Price Updates.
2. Deploy the [`MorphoPythOracle.sol`](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-morpho-wrapper/blob/main/src/morpho-pyth/MorphoPythOracle.sol) contract for the respective price feed pair.

<Steps>

### Schedule Price Updates

As a pull oracle, Pyth's users are typically responsible for updating the state of on-chain feeds.
Please see [What is a Pull Oracle?](/price-feeds/pull-updates) to learn more about pull updates.

Consult [Schedule Price Updates](/price-feeds/schedule-price-updates) guide for more information.

The Pyth Data Association sponsors regular on-chain updates for some price feeds.
See [Sponsored Feeds](./sponsored-feeds.mdx) for the current list of feeds and their update parameters.

If you don't find relevant price IDs in the [Sponsored Feeds](./sponsored-feeds.mdx) list, please contact the Pyth team [here](https://tally.so/r/nGz2jj) to run the Price Pusher for the price feed you need.

### Deploy the Morpho oracle contract

After running the [Price Pusher](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/apps/price_pusher), you can deploy the Morpho oracle contract using the MorphoPythOracle.sol contract.

To deploy a MorphoPythOracle on an EVM chain, we highly recommend using the factory MorphoPythOracleFactory. Please refer to the factory addresses [here](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-morpho-wrapper?tab=readme-ov-file#factory-addresses).

If you don't see the factory address for your chain, you can deploy your own factory by using the [`scripts/MorphoPythOracleFactoryDeploy.s.sol`](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-morpho-wrapper/blob/main/scripts/MorphoPythOracleFactoryDeploy.s.sol) script or by creating an issue on [this repository](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-morpho-wrapper).
If you are deploying, please make sure to update the README.md file with the new factory address.

To do so, run the [`MorphoPythOracleDeploy.s.sol`](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-morpho-wrapper/blob/main/scripts/MorphoPythOracleDeploy.s.sol) script with the following environment variables set:

- `PYTH_ADDRESS`: The Pyth contract address. This is the address of the Pyth contract deployed on the chain. You can find the address of the Pyth contract for each chain [here](./contract-addresses/evm.md).
- `BASE_VAULT`: The ERC4626 token vault for the base asset.
- `BASE_VAULT_CONVERSION_SAMPLE`: A sample amount for converting base vault units.
- `BASE_FEED1`, `BASE_FEED2`: Pyth price feed ids for the base asset. You can find the price feed ids for each asset in our [price feeds directory](./price-feeds.mdx).
- `BASE_TOKEN_DECIMALS`: Decimal precision of the base asset.
- `QUOTE_VAULT`: The ERC4626 token vault for the quote asset.
- `QUOTE_VAULT_CONVERSION_SAMPLE`: A sample amount for converting quote vault units.
- `QUOTE_FEED1`, `QUOTE_FEED2`: Pyth price feed ids for the quote asset. You can find the price feed ids for each asset in our [price feeds directory](./price-feeds.mdx).
- `QUOTE_TOKEN_DECIMALS`: Decimal precision of the quote asset.
- `PRICE_FEED_MAX_AGE`: The maximum age of the price feed in seconds. Note: This adds an extra safety net to avoid using stale prices.
- `SALT`: A unique identifier to create deterministic addresses for deployed oracles.

Check more information about these immutable parameters [here](https://docs.morpho.org/getting-started/resources/contracts/oracles/#immutables) and some assumptions to take into account [here](https://docs.morpho.org/getting-started/resources/contracts/oracles/#assumptions).

<Callout type="info">
  If there is an ERC4626-compliant vault for `BASE_VAULT` or `QUOTE_VAULT`, the
  `BASE_TOKEN_DECIMALS` or `QUOTE_TOKEN_DECIMALS` are still the decimals of the
  underlying asset of the vault, and not the decimals of the Vault itself. E.g:
  for a MetaMorpho WETH vault, as `BASE_VAULT`, the `BASE_TOKEN_DECIMALS` is 18
  as WETH has 18 decimals.
