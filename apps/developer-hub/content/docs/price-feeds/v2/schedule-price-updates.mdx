# How To Schedule Price Updates

The following guides explain how to schedule Pyth price updates to occur at regular intervals.
As a pull oracle, Pyth's users are typically responsible for updating the state of on-chain feeds.
Please see [What is a Pull Oracle?](/price-feeds/pull-updates) to learn more about pull updates.

The Pyth Data Association sponsors regular on-chain updates for some price feeds.
See [Sponsored Feeds](/price-feeds/sponsored-feeds) for the current list of feeds and their update parameters.
If you would like to see additional feeds on this list, please [contact the association via this form](https://tally.so/r/nGz2jj).

There are also three different tools to schedule price updates:

- [Adrastia's Pyth Price Feed Updater](schedule-price-updates/using-adrastia) is a white-glove service that automates price updates based on time and price deviations, supporting any EVM chain.
- [Gelato](schedule-price-updates/using-gelato) provides a turnkey automation solution for scheduled updates.
- [Scheduler](schedule-price-updates/using-scheduler) is a service that developers can run to trigger price updates when certain time or price change conditions are met.

For developers comparing these three options, Adrastia and Gelato are simpler, in that they do not require you to operate a service.
