Each price feed publishes a [robust aggregate](price-feeds/how-pyth-works/price-aggregation) of these prices multiple times per second.
The protocol offers over [1300+ price feeds](https://pyth.network/price-feeds/) covering a number of different asset classes, including US equities, commodities, and cryptocurrencies.

Pythnet Price Feeds are available on [100+ blockchain ecosystems](./price-feeds/contract-addresses), and can also be used in off-chain applications.
They are available on mainnet for most [EVM chains](price-feeds/use-real-time-data/evm.md) -- including Ethereum, BNB, Avalanche, and more --several [Cosmos chains](price-feeds/use-real-time-data/cosmwasm.md), [Solana](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/use-real-time-data/solana),
