Pyth Lazer is a low latency, highly customizable price oracle.
It offers a customizable set of price feeds, target chains (EVM or Solana) and channels (real time or fixed rate):

- Real time channels send updates as frequently as they become available;
- Fixed rate channels send updates at fixed time intervals (you can choose between 50 ms or 200 ms).

The table below shows the difference between Pyth Core and Pyth Lazer:
