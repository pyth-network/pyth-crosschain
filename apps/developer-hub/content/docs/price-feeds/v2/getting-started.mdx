# Getting Started

Integrating Pyth price feeds is quick and easy. Pyth price feeds are permissionless and available on-chain. You **don't** need to sign up or request an API key

Pyth offers several different resources to help you get started.
The [Build](#build) section provides resources for developers integrating Pyth price feeds into their applications.
The [Learn](#learn) section provides general material for anyone interested in understanding how the protocol works.

## Build

Developers interested in using Pyth can refer to the following resources:

- [Create Your First Pyth App](./create-your-first-pyth-app/) is a tutorial that walks the reader through all of the steps required to develop, test and deploy a contract using Pyth price feeds. This guide is tailored toward new developers with less contract development experience.
- [Use Real-Time Price Data](./use-real-time-data/) is a how-to guide that provides the minimal steps to integrate price feeds into your app. This guide is targeted towards more experienced developers who know the basics of smart contract development.
- [API Reference](./api-reference) is an interactive playground that provides a detailed overview of the Pyth smart contract's functionality. This guide is useful for developers who want to understand the full capabilities of the Pyth oracles.

In addition to the resources above, the following reference materials will be useful for developers as they integrate:

- [Price Feed IDs](https://www.pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids) lists the price feed IDs for all the assets supported by Pyth.
- [Contract Addresses](./contract-addresses/) provides the contract addresses for Pyth on different chains.
- [Error Codes](./error-codes.mdx) lists the error codes that can be returned by the Pyth contracts.
- [Best Practices](./best-practices.mdx) explains how to use Pyth price feeds safely and effectively in your application.
