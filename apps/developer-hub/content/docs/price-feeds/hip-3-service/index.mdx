Pyth Network provides **HIP-3 as a Service**, a complete end-to-end solution for deployers launching permissionless perpetual markets on Hyperliquid. This service combines institutional-grade data, managed infrastructure, capital support, and market operations to help you successfully deploy and maintain HIP-3 markets.

## What You Get

HIP-3 as a Service provides everything you need to launch and maintain a successful perpetual market on Hyperliquid:

  />
</div>

## What problem this solves

Deploying and operating a HIP-3 market typically requires all of the following:

- Maintaining continuous **oracle updates every 3 seconds** to meet HIP-3 requirements
- Securing keys and operational processes to reduce downtime and update failures
- Coordinating market-maker liquidity and launch operations

## How It Works

The HIP-3 pusher service monitors price changes and submits signed updates to the Hyperliquid blockchain whenever specific conditions are met (e.g., price deviation or time-based heartbeat).

1.  **Data Sourcing**: The relayer is fully configurable and can connect to any data source that exposes price data via REST API or WebSocket. You can use [Pyth Core](/price-feeds/core), [Pyth Pro](/price-feeds/pro), [SEDA](https://www.seda.xyz/) or [Hyperliquid](https://hyperliquid.xyz/), or plug in your own custom data feeds.
2.  **Robustness & Redundancy**: The service supports fallback configurations to ensure reliability—if the primary data source is unavailable, the next source in the priority chain is used.
3.  **Submission**: Signed transactions are sent to the Hyperliquid validator network to update the market's oracle state.

## Why Pyth

### First-Party Data

Pyth sources data directly from 120+ institutional publishers including exchanges, market makers, and trading firms. This eliminates single points of failure that affect aggregated data providers.

### Market Maker Trust

Pyth's market maker publishers (Jump, Flowdesk, IMC, Amber, Selini) trust Pyth data because they create it themselves. This leads to:

- Higher engagement rates for Pyth-powered markets
- Faster liquidity onboarding

### Redundant Infrastructure

- Primary, secondary, and tertiary infrastructure across multiple regions
- Multi-cloud key management with automatic failover
- Support for multisig oracle updates for operational flexibility
