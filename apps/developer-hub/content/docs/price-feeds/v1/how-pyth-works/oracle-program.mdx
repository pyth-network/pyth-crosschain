# Oracle Program

The oracle program is responsible for several tasks:

1. Maintaining the set of price feeds.
2. Storing the contributions of data providers to each price feed.
3. Combining the individual data providers' prices into a single aggregate price and confidence interval.
4. Performing any additional stateful computations on the resulting price series, such as computing moving averages.

The oracle solves these problems by maintaining a collection of [SVM accounts](../pythnet-reference/account-structure.md) to represent the set of price feeds.
Each feed has two accounts: a product account to store [metadata](../pythnet-reference/product-metadata.md) and a price account.
The price account stores a list of authorized data providers for this specific price feed, and allocates storage space for each data provider's price.
The oracle program exposes an instruction called `upd_price` that enables an authorized data provider to update the price account with their current estimate of the price and confidence interval.
Additionally, the first time that `upd_price` is called in a slot, it will [aggregate](price-aggregation.md) the individual data provider's prices into an aggregate price and confidence interval.
Only the aggregate price and confidence are made available for use in downstream applications; the individual data providers prices are internal state of the oracle program.
Finally, the oracle program computes an [exponentially-weighted moving average](ema-price-aggregation.md) of the oracle price.
