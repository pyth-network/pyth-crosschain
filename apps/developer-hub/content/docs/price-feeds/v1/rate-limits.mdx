# Rate Limits

In order to maximize the reliability of the Pyth Hermes and Benchmarks APIs, a request rate limit is enforced.
All endpoints limits are set at 30 requests every 10 seconds per IP address.

One exception: the TradingView endpoint will allow 90 requests every 10 seconds. Clients issuing request above the limit will receive a 429 (Too Many Requests) response for the subsequent 60-second period.
