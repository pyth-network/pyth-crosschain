# How to Use Real-Time Price Data

The following guides demonstrate how to consume Pyth real-time prices on various blockchains.
These guides are intended for developers building on-chain applications that need price data, i.e., the price data must
be on the blockchain.

Pyth price feeds are available on 40+ blockchain ecosystems.
Check out the complete list of chains and implementation contract addresses at [Contract Addresses](contract-addresses).

If your blockchain is not supported, please [ask in Discord](https://discord.gg/invite/PythNetwork).
Then, consult the relevant ecosystem guide to get started using Pyth real-time price data:

- [EVM](use-real-time-data/evm)
- [Solana](use-real-time-data/solana)
- [Aptos](use-real-time-data/aptos.md)
- [CosmWasm](use-real-time-data/cosmwasm.md)
- [Sui](use-real-time-data/sui.md)
- [IOTA](use-real-time-data/iota.md)
- [Near](use-real-time-data/sui.md)

Pyth price feeds can also be used in off-chain applications.
For example, an application may need to show real-time asset prices on a website.
Developers building such applications can consult the following guide:

- [Off-chain Apps](use-real-time-data/off-chain.md)

Off-chain application developers should also consider using [Benchmarks](../benchmarks).
In addition to real-time data, Benchmarks provides access to historical Pyth prices.
These historical prices are useful for building price charts or graphs.
