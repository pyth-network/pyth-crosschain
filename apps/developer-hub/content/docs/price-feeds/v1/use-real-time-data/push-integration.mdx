# How to Use Real-Time Data using Push Integration

This guide will walk you through the steps to use real-time price data using push integration in various ecosystems.

To use the push integration, developers first need to ensure the feeds used by their application are being updated on-chain.
Refer to the [Push Feeds page](../push-feeds) to see which feeds are being updated on each blockchain.
If your feeds are not listed there, you have several options:

- **Request Feeds**: Fill out [this form](https://tally.so/r/nGz2jj) to request the feeds you need. This is the fastest and simplest way to get your feeds pushed on chain.
- **Run Price Pusher**: Set up and run a [Price Pusher](/price-feeds/schedule-price-updates/using-price-pusher) to automate the process of updating the on-chain price

To use real-time price data using push feeds, developers can use the following code snippet based on the ecosystem:

### EVM

Developers building on EVM chains can use push feeds to consume real-time price data by reading the price from the Pyth oracle smart contract.

```solidity copy
PythStructs.Price memory price = pyth.getPriceNoOlderThan(priceFeedId, 60);
```

Developers only need to pass the price feed ID to the above method from the [Push Feeds list](../push-feeds).

Sample code snippet:

```solidity {30-31} copy
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity/IPyth.sol";
import "@pythnetwork/pyth-sdk-solidity/PythStructs.sol";

contract SomeContract {
  IPyth pyth;

  /**
   * @param pythContract The address of the Pyth contract
   */
  constructor(address pythContract) {
    // The IPyth interface from pyth-sdk-solidity provides the methods to interact with the Pyth contract.
    // Instantiate it with the Pyth contract address from https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/contract-addresses/evm
    pyth = IPyth(pythContract);
  }

  /**
   * This method is an example of how to interact with the Pyth contract using Push Integration.
   */
  function exampleMethod() public {
    // Read the current price from a price feed if it is less than 60 seconds old.
    // Each price feed (e.g., ETH/USD) is identified by a price feed ID.
    // The complete list of feed IDs is available at https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/price-feeds
    bytes32 priceFeedId = 0xff61491a931112ddf1bd8147cd1b641375f79f5825126d665480874634fd0ace; // ETH/USD
    PythStructs.Price memory price = pyth.getPriceNoOlderThan(priceFeedId, 60);
  }
}

```

### SVM

Developers building on SVM chains can use Price Feed Accounts to integrate Pyth using push integration.
The [SVM guide](../use-real-time-data/solana#price-feed-accounts) explains in detail how to integrate Pyth using Price Feed Accounts.

### Aptos

Developers building on Aptos can use push feeds to consume real-time price data by reading the price from the Pyth Oracle smart contract on Aptos.

```rust copy
let btc_price_identifier = x"e62df6c8b4a85fe1a67db44dc12de5db330f7ac66b72dc658afedf0f4a415b43";
let btc_usd_price_id = price_identifier::from_byte_vec(btc_price_identifier);
pyth::get_price(btc_usd_price_id)
```
