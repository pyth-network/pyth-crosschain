          Reveal the random value for a given sequence number and blockchain.


          Given a sequence number, retrieve the corresponding random value that
          this provider has committed to.

          This endpoint will not return the random value unless someone has
          requested the sequence number on-chain.


          Every blockchain supported by this service has a distinct sequence of
          random numbers and chain_id.

          Callers must pass the appropriate chain_id to ensure they fetch the
          correct random number.
