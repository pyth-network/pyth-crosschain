title: Reveal the random value for a given sequence number and blockchain.
description: >-
  Reveal the random value for a given sequence number and blockchain.


  Given a sequence number, retrieve the corresponding random value that this
  provider has committed to.

  This endpoint will not return the random value unless someone has requested
  the sequence number on-chain.


  Every blockchain supported by this service has a distinct sequence of random
  numbers and chain_id.

  Callers must pass the appropriate chain_id to ensure they fetch the correct
  random number.
