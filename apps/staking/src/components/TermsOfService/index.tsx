          By accessing or using the Services, you represent that you understand
          the inherent risks associated with cryptographic
          systems,blockchain-based networks, staking of digital assets
          (including the occurrence of Slashing Penalties); and warrant that you
          have an understanding of the usage and intricacies of digital assets,
          smart contract-based cryptographic tokens, decentralized networks, and
          systems that interact with blockchain-based networks.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          You acknowledge and agree that digital assets are volatile and risky,
          and their staking is affected by many factors outside our or your
          control. You are solely responsible for any transactions, and for all
          fees that you may incur as a result of you staking digital assets,
          including (without limitation) “gas” costs. The Services do not
          control the timing of any transaction, yet you acknowledge that the
          time of a transaction can affect the value of the digital asset or the
          fees associated with a transaction or both. You hereby agree that you
          hold us harmless against any and all claims arising from the
          transaction of your digital assets, or the timing of such
          transactions. Digital assets are not legal tender and are not backed
          by any government. Digital assets are not subject to Federal Deposit
          Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation
          protections. We make no guarantee as to the functionality of any
          digital asset network which might cause delays, conflicts of interest
          or might be subject to operational decisions of third parties that are
          unfavorable to you or affect your digital assets, or lead to your
          inability to complete a transaction. You hold us harmless from and
          against any losses you suffer as a result of your use of such
          third-party services, networks and protocols, including Slashing
          Penalties, even if you access them from our Services. There are no
          guarantees that a transfer initiated via your third-party digital
          wallet on the Services will successfully transfer title of or right in
          any digital assets. You acknowledge that, while the Services and the
          underlying software have been tested, it is still relatively new and
          could have bugs or security vulnerabilities. You further acknowledge
          that the Services and the underlying software are still under
          development and may undergo significant changes over time that may not
          meet Users’ expectations. You acknowledge that your use of certain
          technologies (e.g., jailbreaking tech) on the device with which you
          access the Services, may cause the Services not to work. You
          acknowledge that you accept all risk associated with your use of such
          advanced technologies, and any errors they may cause. You hereby hold
          us harmless from any losses you suffer as a result of your use of such
          technologies.

          including, but not limited to, use of malware, denial of service
          attacks, Sybil attacks, and spoofing. Furthermore, because much of our
          Services rely on open-source software, there is the software
          underlying our code that may contain intentional or unintentional bugs
          or weaknesses which may negatively affect the Services, or result in
          the loss of your digital assets, or your ability to control your
          third-party digital wallet. You hold us harmless from and against any
          losses you suffer as a result of such issues. You agree that your use
          of the Services is subject to, and you will comply with any,
          applicable open-source licenses governing any such open-source

          of the information, content, or services contained in any such
          third-party materials accessible or linked to from the Services. You
          agree and understand that all staking decisions and transactions are
          made solely by you. You agree and understand that under no
          circumstances will the operation of the Services and your use of it be
          deemed to create a relationship that includes the provision of or
          tendering of investment advice. NO FINANCIAL, INVESTMENT, TAX, LEGAL
          OR SECURITIES ADVICE IS GIVEN THROUGH OR IN CONNECTION WITH OUR
          SERVICES. No content found on the Services, whether created by us or
          another User is or should be considered as investment advice. You

          and shall in no circumstances be liable in connection with, your
          decisions to use the Services. Nothing contained on the Services
          constitutes a solicitation, recommendation, endorsement, or offer by
          us or any third party to stake, buy or sell any digital assets,
          securities, or other financial instruments. Neither us nor any of our
          affiliates has: (1) evaluated the merit of any non-custody staking
          mechanisms available through the Services; or (2) has endorsed or
          sponsored any digital assets made available.
