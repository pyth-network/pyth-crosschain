        OIS allows anyone to help secure Pyth and protect DeFi. Through
        decentralized staking rewards and slashing, OIS incentivizes Pyth
        publishers to maintain high-quality data contributions. PYTH holders can
        stake to publishers to further reinforce oracle security. Rewards are
        programmatically distributed to high quality publishers and the stakers
        supporting them to strengthen oracle integrity.

                  The total rewards generated by a stake pool depends on the
                  total number of tokens staked by the publisher and any
                  stakers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As more tokens are staked to that pool, the stake pool’s total
                  potential rewards increases, up to a limit called the stake
                  cap. Publishers can raise their stake cap by supporting more
                  symbols (price feeds). Rewards are programmatically
                  distributed to publishers who provided high quality price data
                  that epoch. Any remaining rewards are distributed among the
                  stakers who supported these publishers. Publishers have
                  priority over rewards.

                <p>
                  The Pyth DAO sets a maximum reward rate for stake pools,
                  currently set at 10%. This rate is achieved for a pool when
                  the total stake is below the stake cap. If the stake cap is
                  exceeded, the reward rate for stakers is reduced.

                  Publishers charge a fixed percentage (20%) of the rewards from
                  stakers in their stake pool as a delegation fee (net of any
                  slashed amount). The Pyth DAO can vote to adjust this fee
                  structure. Learn more about staking rewards in the

                  Slashing helps ensures the integrity of Pyth Price Feeds by
                  penalizing publishers who provide inaccurate data. This
                  mechanism protects the oracle network but may affect your
                  stake if a publisher pool you delegate tokens towards is
                  penalized.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The current slashing rate is capped at 5% of publisher and
                  delegated stakes, and this rate can be adjusted by the Pyth
                  DAO. The slashed amounts are sent to the DAO wallet. The Pyth
                  DAO can choose to vote on future decisions for these slashed
                  amounts, such as opting to send them to parties affected by an
                  oracle misprint or using them in another way to support Pyth
                  Network.

                  <p>
                    A higher stake cap for a stake pool allows that publisher to
                    increase the pool’s notional rewards.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A publisher can increase their stake cap by supporting more
                    symbols. The pool’s notional rewards may be a factor to
                    consider when selecting a publisher to stake with. The
                    maximum reward rate functions as an absolute limit to any
                    publisher stake pool’s yield potential.

              answer: (

                  <p>
                    When you commit to unstaking tokens from a publisher, those
                    tokens will first undergo a first phase of the Cooldown
                    Period from the time of clicking Unstake to the end of the
                    current epoch. These tokens still actively contribute to
                    oracle integrity and remain eligible to programmatic
                    rewards.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After this first phase, these tokens will undergo a second
                    phase in the Cooldown Period lasting one full epoch, during
                    which the tokens are no longer eligible to programmatic
                    rewards. These tokens are subject to slashing if a misprint
                    in the previous epoch is identified. Once this phase
                    concludes, your tokens will become unstaked and can be
                    restaked or withdrawn to your wallet.

              answer:
                "Yes, you can still stake tokens to a pool whose total stake exceeds its stake cap. In this situation, the programmatic reward rate for stakers mathematically decreases as the amount of remaining rewards in the pool must be shared with more delegated tokens.

                    Anyone can choose to raise a report for a plausible data
                    misprint. The Pythian Council of the Pyth DAO will then
                    review the reference data provided and compare against the
                    Pyth data to determine whether a slashing event should
                    occur. The council will have until the end of the epoch
                    after the epoch of the reported incident to review the
                    report. The tokens subject to slashing are the tokens
                    eligible for rewards{" "}
                    <i>during the epoch of the misprint incident</i>.

                  <p>
                    In the unlikely event that a published aggregate has been
                    found to be erroneous, a slashing event would then be
                    triggered. The stakes of the subset of publishers who
                    contributed to this incorrect aggregate are programmatically
                    slashed, along with the stakes of anyone who delegated
                    tokens towards them. Such slashing event occurs during the
                    epoch after the epoch of the reported incident.

                    affected by the oracle misprint or using them in another way
